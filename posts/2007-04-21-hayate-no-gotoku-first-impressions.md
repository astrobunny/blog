 ![Nagi](images/blog/hng1.png)Every time a new piece of anime comes out, I miss it. Well, although I missed this one, I'm still gonna blog about it. Enter Hayate no Gotoku, this is one anime that caught my attention. The moment I heard its sounds emanating from my flatmates' room, I knew I had to watch it. This story is about an ordinary boy attending an ordinary high school who has been sold to some<s> very generous people</s> ordinary loansharks after borrowing 156,804,000 Yen, and basically just ran off leaving the debt to him as a Christmas present.<!--more--> To be honest, I ![](images/blog/hng4.png)did not laugh at the way it was put up. The anime has a nice amount of laughs and seriousness in it. Well, the next paragraph would be considered spoilers but since I'm talking about the first episode it really doesn't matter since you can't talk about anime without introducing it and episode one is an introduction.  
  
So, I'll just talk briefly. ![](images/blog/hng2.png)  
  
The parents, who used the money, possibly for playing with stocks, were despicable and not worthy of any pity. Yes. Hayate was the victim of it all. Well, what happened was during an exodus he ran into an obscenely rich girl who was trying to buy warm drinks from a vending machine using a credit card (lol). However, halfway thru, a pair of boys who also owed money to the same loan shark decided to kidnap her and ransom the money to pay the loan shark. Of course, Hayate in his desperate situation was also debating whether or not to ransom her, but instead messed up and ended up saving her from them.  
  
Anyway, its a fairly light story with nicely rendered animation and a lot of humour and randomness to boot. I especially like the part where a misunderstanding becomes an integral part of the story. Yes, misunderstandings are very common techniques to add to the humour in a story. Thus, we shall see what goes on next. I may be a little late for this since 3 episodes have already been subbed by Static-Subs, however, this story has potential to be very good and very funny and thus all who love Haruhi and Negima should watch this. Or it could be another ordinary anime with an ordinary plot and the ordinary things expected from an ordinary anime.
