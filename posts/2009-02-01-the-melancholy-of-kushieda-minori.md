Toradora 17's out with a new arc. This episode really intrigued me because our happy-go-lucky friend Minorin has suddenly shed her shell of laughter and happiness and suddenly put on a face of melancholy and gloom. For some, this is a very new development. Though I've said that I liked Minorin's hyper outside, I saw this coming. Minorin's past happy-happy outer shell seemed nothing more than a cover up to some much deeper problems after a while, and just longs to share it with someone.

However, lets have a look at the events that have passed that has led to this development with Minorin. She has always managed to be the flat character that never changes in attitude, and is always smiling and doing random things

How did she manage to overwhelm herself so much that her inner gloom started spilling out? Was it because she wanted attention just like Kitamura did with yellow hair?

Her ideas were always to do all sorts of silly things that would baffle and astound people in such weird ways that they wouldn't think twice about what's going on while they were sweating and staying quiet upon experiencing the utter randomness of her antics.

Minorin probably started showing her more human side while Ryuuji tried to probe further into her during the summer trip at Ami's vacation house. At that time, the ice broke, and Minorin suddenly tended to open up more to Ryuuji than she could before

Of course, there was this time when Minorin was about to divulge a very deep secret when Ryuuji interrupted her. She probably wanted to say something that was important to what is going on in the present day.

When she found out that Taiga's father was around and Ryuuji was trying to get them together again, she did not hesitate to throw off her sheep's clothing and attempt to stop Ryuuji and Taiga from doing things that may end up hurting Taiga again.

Of course, that did not bode well for their friendship, while they made out eventually, the awkwardness between Minorin and Ryuuji was still there.

So, perhaps Minorin had many things going on in her mind. One would be how she hasn't been able to gain as much attention as Kitamura had during his yellow hair episode, or Taiga during the school fest, or she may even be bothered about what Ryuuji was thinking when they ran across that finish line. Either way, Minorin is experiencing a phase of possible depression, but nothing more than that, and I'm confident the old randommonger will be back soon enough.
