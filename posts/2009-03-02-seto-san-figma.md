Today, after obtaining yet another 4 boxes, I was in a slight pinch. I wanted to blog about a figma tonight, but I didn't know what to. Thanks to Novajinx, NotokawaiiyoNoto, Jaser and Ineser, it seems a small impromptu vote on various channels I came up with had Seto winning 4-2 to the Witch Nagato figma. So, since Seto won, its her turn to get the welcome figma treatment.

Seto comes with quite an array of accessories, but not as many as the Witch Nagato though. She's got her sword, her mermaid fin, another face, 8 hands and a nekomimi band! Hands up if any of you want cute pictures of Neko Seto, because I didn't take any in the short span of time I had to write this blog post.

I must say she really is a very well made figure. The slightly longer than most skirt made her look all the more attractive. (I like conservative girls). The knees are so well made, they almost completely conceal the joint. Not that joints matter to me, but its evidence that the figma makers are just getting better and better at this stuff. The result? Higher quality figmas for us all.

Her body is also quite well made. I love how her chest is amply pumped up to emphasize on her beautiful figure. Likewise, the hair, although having a rather ordinary colour, is nothing short of good-looking. Just look at how the light reflected off it.

I don't know about you but I tend to look at figures from the back for a change sometimes. It makes you wonder what they are thinking...

YOU SHALL NOT PASS.

Omae nanimono da?! I know. Shana's sword looks crooked. That's because it broke once and I bent it too much. I'll fix it properly later on when I get my tools shipped in. Right now it seems Shana is selling a fight to Seto. Japanese tip: In Japanese people say けんかを売る。 This literally means "To sell a fight" it actually means "to pick a fight" with someone. You can hear it from Kagamin sometimes when Konata makes jokes at her expense. You can also jokingly say it to someone who teases you. Though I wouldn't do that if it was unnatural because it would actually make the situation even more awkward.

Looks like swords are drawn. DOES THIS MEAN BATTLE?

Anyway, here's a little picture to illustrate how soft Seto's sidebangs are.

She looks so cute putting her sword back into its scabbard. I wonder why otakus like violent women so much. It must be the inherent instinct we that was ingrained in us humans since 10,000 years ago, when Neanderthal tribes continued to scour the surface of the Earth. The need to protect our offspring to keep the Homo Sapiens species alive would be made so much easier when we mated with girls who could fight. That way they would be able to protect the kids while we were away strangling mammoths for food.  
  
And now, for the obligatory pantsu shot:

Oh woops. She decided that she wanted to go for a swim. In my opinion, the theory that mermaids would lose their legs whenever they come into contact with water just doesn't hold. This is because in terms of water, they would be full of it, and thus never be able to grow legs. Of course, it may just be that their skin has a natural reaction to large amounts of water being poured on it and it would be the stimulation that would cause the fins to grow out.

Say hi to Seto the Mermaid. Her fish body really looks like one of those big fish kept in the aquariums in posh Chinese restaurants. Not that I'm gonna eat her or anything. Or maybe, I dunno. Forget it.

View from the back. It does look hard to walk in such an attire. I wonder if anyone has cosplayed mermaids lately.
