No matter how you look at it, Kuroko is the dorm's resident squid. She gets twisted and folded till her bones make sounds and she gets thrown around like a fresh jellyfish. Not to mention her twintails exaggerate the look of a dead squid.

Said squid is also the dorm manager's pet.

Because Kuroko is so cute, she loves to squeeze her up and make her all mushy mushy

I'm sure she harbors some sort of liking for extremely cute little twintailed girls who compress like a sponge when you grab them.

I'm sure Kuroko enjoys it too, since she doesn't get enough from Onee-sama lately.
