**Kagami** : You know, I wonder why some people keep going after voice actors nowadays. Some voice actors are even becoming as famous as the anime characters that they voice.<!--more-->  
**Miyuki** : Maybe its because people find it fascinating to hear people speak like the characters they like in the show. After all, the graphics can be copied and re-created, but the voice only belongs to one person. Perhaps some people see that as precious and pursue voice actors since they remind them of the characters they love.

**Kagami** : Maybe its just human nature to pursue 3D.  
**Miyuki** : What do you mean?

**Kagami** : I think that deep down everyone knows you can't do much with a shadow cast on your screen. Personally I don't see what's so attractive about 2D people, they are just a bunch of unrealistically rendered set of frames that somewhat resemble a real person, and has pay absolutely no attention to the laws of physics. God I don't even know why everybody is so fired up about trying to pass laws that allow marriages with 2D characters. 3D for the win!  
**Miyuki** : Eh heh heh...

**Kagami** : I'm serious! Its just weird and disgusting that people actually gratify themselves looking at girls made up of a bunch of thin lines and get their table and screen all dirty from it, like what they said in the opinion column.  
**Miyuki** : Heh heh......

**Kagami** : Come to think of it I wonder what happened to that little marriage with 2D thing. 2ch has been a little quiet lately. There aren't as many posts on those threads anymore.  
**Miyuki** : Maybe its just a passing fad for them, you know, like something to talk about maybe?

**Kagami** : Nah I think they've decided to get out of their lonely lives in their tiny 3 by 2 room and start chasing some real girls, like that guy who was trying to make an impression by bowing and greeting the voice actor during the line-up autograph session! HAHAHA. I can't believe he spent $250 just to be able to stand in front of her.  
**Miyuki** : Well... at least they did put in some effort...
