Woot. I managed to waste a whole day playing C&C3 again. I got C&C3 like a short while after it came out but I didn't enjoy it due to Vista eating up every single bit of my computer's processing power leaving crap for the game. Thus, after I upgraded to XP, I decided to try it out today and omg I was stuck. I even forgot to get screenshots till now. BUT! I have screenshots right here of the 4th GDI mission fighting the Scrin. Yes. The new Alien race in Command and Conquer 3. OMG they are nothing like the GDI and Nod. "Well, at least you knew the Nods were human" - some GDI soldier during the scrin mission.  
  
I could imagine how terrified they had been when they saw the Scrin bugs walk around in more than 3 legs. Strangely they don't hide the names of the units, so when the soldiers were freaking out asking "WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!?" someone else replied "Like hell I know!", and all I had to do was click on it, and woo... Devastator Warship. How nice. I wish I could ask them to click on it too and they'll know the name too.

Don't ask me what those are. I never bothered. They look like flying waterskis with lasers.

I like big guns a lot. They make killing so much easier
