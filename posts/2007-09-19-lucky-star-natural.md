Some people really have that awesome pwning inherent trait that makes them so likeable that you would jump off a cliff because your life is sadder than a horse that lost one of its legs. I'm being sarcastic here. But seriously. They are so likeable you'd hate yourself for liking them. (I think I said that before) If I had a girlfriend named Miyuki and is just like her, I'd go to mass everyday and say 5 decades just because I'd be eternally grateful for the greatest prize given to man.
