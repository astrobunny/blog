Ok so this episode starts off with this.

... and then ends up with this? What the hell? So what happened to Sokabe anyway?

This is a classic example of development that happened in the beginning of the story getting shoved aside for another story that isn't anywhere near as good as what would've happened if the first story was continued.

Though I guess that story was required to develop Chikura a bit more before embarking on a journey towards a relationship with Sokabe. But still...

It's so abrupt! Even Sokabe feels shocked. I know that teenagers with their raging hormones and all cause them to put priorities over people whom they've most recently met only.

Lets just hope the next Chikura episode is going to expand on this.

God how the hell do people learn to paint like this...
