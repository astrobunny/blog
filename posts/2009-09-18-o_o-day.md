Hayate 24's main feature is a very cute very chibi Hinagiku. Not so much the tsundere character but more the altophobic Hinagiku. She gets dragged around a lot this episode so its not really appealing. I prefer her when she's a bit more assertive. Not that much blushing either, so there wasn't much appeal on that side.

Come to think of it she is still pretty active for an altophobic at high altitudes. I'm altophobic too, but usually I go quiet and still when I'm not in my element.

In other news, there has been a lot of cute Hinagiku this episode. All I see now is that the missing Nagi in Sakuya's house is just a filler plot for the episode.

There should not be any question now why Hinagiku is my favorite character of the series.

Perhaps JC Staff is trying to cash in on the popularity of Lucky Star-like semi-chibi character designs?
