Tsukasa grew a bit this year. Much to Kagamin's despair.

Because I didn't have a bamboo, I could only put a piece of cardboard outside the house and hang a strip of paper on it. Since Orihime and Hikoboshi are Japanese, I needed to write it in Japanese so they would understand. I wonder if it will take 25 years for my wishes to come true...
