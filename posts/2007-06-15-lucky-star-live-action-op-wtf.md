This is not something you DON'T blog about the moment you see it. Yes. It's friggin' weird. But at least they did a good job doing the scenes, except the boys were... well... out of place. The dancing, well it does feel a little unenthusiastic to say the least. They could have made it livelier. Also, whats with LOL Fang sensei having black hair!? It should be YELLOW. Anyway, I'd really like to see someone try harder XD.
