Working life has really taken a toll on me. Whatever it is I want to do, I fail to do because I always end up being too tired to do it. I used to come home from uni and do all sorts of things with friends, come back, post on the blog, do some programming, watch anime. But now, all I get home to do is sleep. It's as if I'm living my life for the sake of work. SIGH...  
  
In other news... I got my Christmas present to self! My very first online figure purchase, and the first part of my Project Red Machine. Pictures after the jump. I haven't opened the box proper yet. That will have to wait until all the parts of my Red Machine arrive.

After ripping the labels off the box, I see a small slit of light...

The opening becomes wider, and finally, the womb reveals itself...

I must say [BeNippon](http://benippon.com/) has put a lot of effort into packing this figure for me. Thanks to them, I got mine straight from Japan! I always thought all hope was lost when I could not get from Amazon.co.jp, but now a savious has come to rescue us. Once again, not bad for an upstart figure trading company. Since they are located in Japan, its likely they can get stock far faster than HLJ or PlayAsia who didn't have any more of these figures when I wanted it. Kudos and rep to you!
