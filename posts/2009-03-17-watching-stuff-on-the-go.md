Sometimes when you're sitting on a train you look at some wonderful things and wonder what Akari would say when she saw it. Well, if you own the DVDs, there are nice groups who produce anime encodes for the PSP and DS (with subtitles). Now you don't have to mutter the words "HAZUKASHII SERIFU KINSHI" to yourself while you try and imagine the scene where Akari treats herself to the amazing views of Neo-Venezia

Obviously, you'll be watching them low-res, so it would be ideal if you don't strain your eyes to see fine details, and just relax and enjoy the show.
