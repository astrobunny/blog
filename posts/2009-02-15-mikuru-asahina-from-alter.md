After many months of procrastination, I have finally found the motivation to actually post about this figure. First of all however, allow me to announce that this is the FIRST post done on this blog using WordLaunch, a blogging client I have designed and written myself to efficiently write posts with many images in them. I will provide announcements about this blog client of mine on my labs site eventually. Also, I'd like to give a big thank you to mellow\_bunny for selling me this figure. I would've paid a ton for shipping to get this gorgeous figure if not for him. Ok, with that out of the way, lets get into looking at what this Mikuru Asahina Figure by Alter really is.

Like all other figures made by self-respecting figure makers, the figure comes packaged in a nice box with a window showing how well the figure is protected from shock. Close inspection reveals that there the many folds of plastic inside are little pieces of plastic that keep coloured parts separate from each other. This prevents anything not white make marks on anything that is white and vice versa. It may seem like a small thing but it may happen when the box is subject to powerful blows or drops.

View of the top of the box. The big H doesn't really mean ecchi. But you can take it that way if you want to...

The back of the box has quite an accurate picture of figure inside.

The box viewed from the right side. More design and emphasis that this character in fact, comes from the anime Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu.

The box from the left side. It is interesting how the designers come up with so many ways to present something with so few colours.

The box viewed from the bottom. There's this bit of notices that say that this figure should be kept out of reach of children under 15 years of age and stuff. I'm not sure why, but I personally would to prevent them from damaging her.  
  
  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-img-5611-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-img-5611.jpg)  
  
  
  
Right. Now lets open the box and have a look at what we have inside...  
  
  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-img-5612-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-img-5612.jpg)  
  
  
  
There's a plastic frame on the inside that wraps around the figure and doubles as a shock absorber. It is made of two pieces of plastic moulded to the shape of the figure, and is held together by little pressure bumps (I'm not sure what you call those notches that stick together because they fit so well inside each other).  
  
  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-img-5613-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-img-5613.jpg)  
  
  
  
She's coming out...  
  
  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-img-5615-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-img-5615.jpg)  
  
  
  
So that's her inside the plastic frame. You can see the stand she comes with. I had a bit of trouble with it initially, you'll see why later.

After removing the top part of the plastic framing, we can see Mikuru lying comfortably inside her plastic chamber.

She must be removed from this chamber with the utmost care.

Here, I attempt to get her feet to connect to the plastic stand. I'm not sure if I got it around the right way, but it certainly seemed like she was meant to be attached to the stand from the far side. The notches were however, too close, so I seemed to have to bend her legs to be able to get the hole in her foot.

In an effort to not destroy my $40 figure, I just left her leg standing on it.

This is a very decent figure, because unlike Shana, her dress is quite long and you have to look from a very low angle to be able to see her panties. She is wearing a pantyhose however, so the panties only appear as a bit of white.  
  
  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-img-5636-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-img-5636.jpg)  
  
  
  
She looks very happy doing her job.

I may be biased after buying this figure, but I believe that this is one of the few instances where Alter has managed to do a better job than Max Factory.

Her colours are slightly dull compared to Max Factory's Asahina, but they are a good dull. In other words, they don't make her look too bright, which gives her a more realistic feel. Not that anime is supposed to be realistic. I'm just saying that I appreciate this feel better.

Here's me imitating Danny Choo and taking photos of my figures next to my MacBook.

Shana has a friend now.

Shana dun look too happy here. Probably because she thinks Mikuru is flaunting her breasts.
