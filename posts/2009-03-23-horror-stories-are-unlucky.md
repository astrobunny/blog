There's a reason I stay really far away from horror story books. Its that I found the hard way that nothing good comes after a good read of a horror story. There was this once I read a horror story book, and in an exam the next day, my mind completely blanked out for some reason, even though the exam was a math exam, something I don't usually have to study for. Then, after reading Singaporean Horror Stories in the school's library, I came out and tripped and scraped my knee. And there was this once where I got food poisoning the next day just after going to KFC for a nice meal after having a good read at Belle's Bookstore. Guess what I was reading.  
  
Horror movies are fine though, I don't really remember getting anything bad from it. Actually, there was this once I found a $10 note after walking out of the cinema. Honest me tried to find the owner but devil me decided to keep it anyway. But horror story books tend to be omens of bad luck for me for some reason.
