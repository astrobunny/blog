I don't know about you, but I don't think I would marry any of those girls I see in Saki. The reason being, I don't want to end up having to fund some fat auntie's mahjong games while she sits around and plays mahjong all day with her other friends and watch Hong Kong soaps at the same time. I'm not saying that girls who play mahjong have a reduced marriageability though. I'm just saying that's my perception of girls who play mahjong seriously. What's your take on this?
