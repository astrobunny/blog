Its March 3rd again, and the festival of girls. But there has always been a persona that has been close to my heart. She does not really even stand out in terms of popularity or significance, but perhaps it is because that perfection was something that I have never been able to attain.  
  
One of the greatest parts of her character has always been her balance against Hayate, and that was a significant part of why I enjoyed watching her so much. Perhaps it is for these reasons birthdays allow a character some life outside of their shows.
