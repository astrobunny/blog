If there is one thing I find interesting about Hayate no Gotoku, is the number of easter eggs I can expect to see in the show. In at least one or two parts of the story, I get to see some random reference to another anime again. Today however, this was a bit unexpected. When Hayate said he prefers 2-D girls, I was like... がーん, and I saw something that I thought God forbade to be ever shown again. Anyway, today's story is relatively meaningless, save for the fact that Hayate has not caught up on his life before Nagi and that all of us almost forgot that there was a dere character in the first episode. Read on for a really really REALLY big spoiler.
