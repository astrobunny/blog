This week, our hero gets into more trouble as he (thinks that he) can't return with a ruined expensive cashmere coat. But... something worse awaits him at the Sanzenin Mansion. <!--more-->

Basically, since Hayate knows how valuable the coat Maria gave him is, he is afraid of going home. Little did he know that that was going to be the least of his worries, as the gang that once pursued him for his parents' debt were nearby, and spotted him. Also, the bodyguards of Isumi thinks that he is responsible for kidnapping her (but he saved her and got her to her destination), resulting in both groups attempting to corner Hayate and do him in.

But in the Mansion, Isumi finally meets up with Nagi, and explains everything. When Hayate arrives back at the Mansion, small misunderstandings caused Nagi to lock him outside causing him to catch a cold. However, Nagi then tried to redeem herself by cooking for Hayate. I'll leave that to your imagination. Then, another surprise comes in the form of a maid from another family visiting the Mansion.

I agree with what the narrator said at the end. The plot is finally starting to move, instead of pure irrelevant randomness. Its funny how they make that simple-minded childlike Isumi look sooo sexy in bed. Those who have watched this episode might find their right arm a bit bigger at the end of the day. I'd really like to see what Nagi's f\*\*\*\*\*\* is gonna do next week with Hayate and what Nagi's gonna say about all this. Meanwhile, Nagi's friend from Kansai continues to watch DVDs in an attempt to a\*\*\*d N\*\*\*'s f\*\*d.
