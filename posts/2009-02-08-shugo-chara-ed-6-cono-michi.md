As a dedicated Shugo Chara fan, I felt obliged to make this post of the newest ED of Shugo Chara Doki! This new song came out just yesterday while I was watching Shugo Chara and came as quite a surprise, considering ED 5 wasn't even out for that long. Anyway, enjoy the Ami-centered video!  
  
Lyrics follow.

この道歩いてくよ  
Kono michi aruiteku yo  
Just keep walking down this path  
  
何があろうとも  
Nani ga arou to mo  
I'm sure something lies ahead.  
  
ボクたち　チカラ　合わせた時  
BOKUtachi CHIKARA awaseta toki  
When we combine our efforts,  
  
何かが変わるさ  
Nanikaga kawaru sa  
Something will change.  
  
絶対ってことばをね  
Zettai tte kotoba wo ne  
I hate the word "definitely"  
  
君はすぐ使うけれど  
Kimi wa sugu tsukau kere do  
Because you never hesitate to use it.  
  
もう少しだけ　考えよう  
mou sukoshi dake kangaeyou  
Why don't you think about it a little more  
  
それしかできないのか？？？  
Sore shika dekinai no ka???  
Do you really think that's all you can do???  
  
微妙なココロの動き  
Bimyou na KOKORO no ugoki  
All those small emotions that we have  
  
わかるようになってきたよね  
wakaru you ni natte kita yo ne  
I hope we'll understand it someday  
  
自分の実力なんてもんも  
jibun no jitsu ryoku nante mon mo  
No matter what we are really capable of  
  
たいしたことないし  
taishita koto nai shi  
They aren't very much  
  
１本だけじゃ　折れちゃう弓矢も  
ippon dake ja orechau yumiya mo  
Even though one blow could break a bow and arrow  
  
３本、勇気百倍  
sanbon, yuuki hyakubai  
It takes 3 to make you a hundred times braver  
  
この道歩いてくよ  
kono michi aruiteku yo  
Let's continue down this path  
  
険しい道でも  
kewashii michi de mo  
Even if it's a dangerous one  
  
ボクたち　魂　合わせた時  
BOKUtachi KOKORO awaseta toki  
If we combine our efforts  
  
何かが変わるよ  
nani ka ga kawaru yo  
Something will surely change.
