As promised, here are some of the references made in Hayate no Gotoku Episode 10, as a result of Hata Sensei's storytelling. Referencing of this magnitude in this series is unprecedented and warrants a double post on the same episode. I ain't an otaku like Konata to the point where I could sing some "Masked Man"-style old Japanese intro song to some obscure anime, but I am able to point out at least some of it after some amount of research. A big thank you goes to ineser and randomc for helping me point these out!<!--more-->  
  
First off, after the message to all the kids to brighten up the room and sit far from the TV to watch, there's Maria singing on TV with a star as her headband, and then on a robot hand. Yes. Most people may get this, since this is from a relatively recent series Gundam Seed Destiny.

Immediately after the opening, there's this scene with the console with the writing "Anal Computer" Yes. there is not typo. It really is ANAL COMPUTER, but not in the literal sense. The Japanese like to shorten English phrases like "Basket Ball" into "Basuketto" and "Departmental Store" to "Depaato". Thus, "Analog computer" should be "Anal Computer" XD.

Next is Maria with a bunch of paper on the wall saying 'things'.  

  
|  
 <wpg2idlightbox>395</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
The paper on the leftmost side is Tokachi Tsukuchite from an Idolmaster game. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNWbs2DcOto  
The one in the middle is some illegible characters. However, judging from the characters on the leftmost side of the piece of paper, "by　まりあ", I'm guessing its a ripoff of Negima!?'s episode title screens. "Today is ... by Maria"  
The one on the right is "ゲームは一日一時間" which means "Play a game an hour a day" by Takahashi Meijin, who is famous for his 16 pushes per second trigger finger.  
  
Next is a familiar scene of Nagi complaining about Sakuya talking about going to school and it happening inside the TV. Looks like Nagi is wearing a Kame-sennin jacket from DBZ and had her hair tied up like Asuna from Mahou Sensei Negima. Though, its not the same bells, I think I have seen these bells tied in the same style in some other anime, but I can't put my finger on it.

Next reference, is at the Demon's Castle, when the really strange last boss, the Great Stygian of Abe (Temporary) is actually a girl with very very annoying bouncing breasts that sound like some error wave file from some old polyphonic video game (ugh) introduces herself. There, in the window you can see two shadows which is most likely beyond the shadow of a doubt, Shichimi and Motsu from Negima!?

 <wpg2idlightbox>403</wpg2idlightbox> <wpg2idlightbox>405</wpg2idlightbox><wpg2idlightbox>407</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
Then after she comes up with the really strange idea of baiting someone to fight her and set her free with game controllers, there's this scene of Klaus's room where we see 2 Detective Conan statues.  

  
|  
 <wpg2idlightbox>411</wpg2idlightbox><wpg2idlightbox>409</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
Of course, the ever-unfortunate Hayate manages to step on it twice.  

  
|  
 <wpg2idlightbox>414</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
<wpg2idlightbox>417</wpg2idlightbox>  
  
And during that time when Isumi's bodyguards are running around the Mansion, we get another Detective Conan statue wearing the Papillion Mask o.o;;

 <wpg2idlightbox>420</wpg2idlightbox><wpg2idlightbox>423</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
It just gets better. After that, 2 awesome Rozen-maiden style images of Maria and Wataru's maid are shown, combined with Shana from Shakugan no Shana's signature quote "URUSAI URUSAI URUSAAAAAI!!" It took me a while to get these Fireworked together so be grateful while you fap.

 <wpg2idlightbox>426</wpg2idlightbox><wpg2idlightbox>429</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
Next, the 3 clueless classmates of Nagi actually manage to fall into the game console controller trap. (LOL) And fall out of what looks like a hole created by Doraemon's Time Machine.  

  
|  
 <wpg2idlightbox>432</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
Of course, in that picture, we also see a flower that has sunglasses that look like Harima's sunglasses from School Rumble  

  
|  
 <wpg2idlightbox>488</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
In the game world where the three ended up in, Risa has got this big death symbol on top of her. Apparently its similar to the Doom spell from Final Fantasy. (Of course don't ask where the guy behind comes from. Mary Poppins perhaps?)  

  
|  
 <wpg2idlightbox>435</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
Of course, after that we get a wonderful fanservice shot of Risa getting pwned by the slime. I will not be liable for you running out of toilet paper or slightly larger right arm by tomorrow. But have fun anyway.  

  
|  
 <wpg2idlightbox>438</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
Then we get another reference, but this time from Neon Genesis Evangelion. Its Rei Ayanami! And she looks horrible...  

  
|  
 <wpg2idlightbox>441</wpg2idlightbox><wpg2idlightbox>444</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
Then, we have a scene where the other classmate gets shocked by electricity coming out of nowhere and a picture of Oscar from the Blues Brothers sticking out the right bottom corner.  

  
|  
 <wpg2idlightbox>446</wpg2idlightbox><wpg2idlightbox>449</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
And after the shocking finished, we get Jimmy Hendricks  

  
|  
 <wpg2idlightbox>452</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
<wpg2idlightbox>455</wpg2idlightbox>  
  
Then while the girls climb up the hill with Risa as a coffin, we get Hayate (gay) singing in his neko-mimi mode costume the song Boku wa Kimi no Mono... (I gotta admit, this scene sure looks like it was meant to be gay. I can't find any reason to feel Hayate looks attractive in a cosplay costume like that and him singing that song just made me want to puke.)  

  
|  
 <wpg2idlightbox>457</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
The stuff Hayate sang was something like this:  
  
どこかで僕を呼んでいる　泣き出しそうな叫びが響く  
今すぐ行くから!　だって僕はもう、キミのもの  
  
ひどく身勝手な人混みに押されて  
堅いアスファルト　倒されそうな時は  
ほら大丈夫　そっと抱き寄せるよ  
守...  
  
After that, we go back to the Sanzenin mansion where Isumi gets lost and senses some ghost and opens some door with some writings on it which is supposed to say 恋愛成就！出会い系, which means "The result of love, depends on how much you see each other" or something like that, and Nagi says the top three is in Part B! Whatever that means. Anyway, then we get to see a very very familiar looking eyecatch.  

  
|  
 <wpg2idlightbox>460</wpg2idlightbox><wpg2idlightbox>463</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
MikuruSumeshi Beam!! (Yuko Goto is playing the Demon King in this episode. She was the seiyuu for Mikuru Asahina in Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu. surprise surprise!)  
  
Apparently in another eyecatch, Nagi is wearing the uniform of the Tristein Magical Academy of Zero no Tsukaima.  

  
|  
 <wpg2idlightbox>465</wpg2idlightbox><wpg2idlightbox>471</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
Next, I couldn't help but wonder, since episode 7 or 8, if this girl really is supposed to look like Tenma from School Rumble?  

  
|  
 <wpg2idlightbox>474</wpg2idlightbox><wpg2idlightbox>477</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
After that, we get Miki summoning King Sccasher from Knight Lamune & 40. Apparently the series has never been subbed nor dubbed, so wouldn't be too famous. Pity. The scene was made so nicely, it would have resembled the actual summoning scene itself. The thing I don't get is, she did all that to make a phone call to the President? Oh well, I guess to communicate between worlds you need some really awesome power of some sort and abbreviating the rest.

 <wpg2idlightbox>479</wpg2idlightbox><wpg2idlightbox>485</wpg2idlightbox><wpg2idlightbox>482</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
Then some more fun stuff passes, including some fan mail making fun of Maria being 17 years old. I mean, what's up with that? Didn't she already tell us? Then, all of a sudden, Klaus looks like Akuma from Street fighter...  

  
|  
 <wpg2idlightbox>490</wpg2idlightbox><wpg2idlightbox>493</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
And finally, close to the ending, We see Hinagiku dressed up like Akazukin from Otogi-Juushi Akazukin. OMG she looks so hot. \>\_\< and Izumi is Shirayuki hime and Miki is Ibarahime.

 <wpg2idlightbox>495</wpg2idlightbox><wpg2idlightbox>498</wpg2idlightbox><wpg2idlightbox>502</wpg2idlightbox><wpg2idlightbox>500</wpg2idlightbox> |
  

  
And a friend of mine pointed out that the sword attached to Risa's coffin's back is a sword out of Maple Story. Maybe someone could give me a clue as to if that's really the case? I wouldn't know! ^^;  
  
... and OMG that's a lot of takoyaki.  
<wpg2idlightbox>504</wpg2idlightbox>  
  
I guess that's all... Tell me if I missed something! I'm sure I did.
