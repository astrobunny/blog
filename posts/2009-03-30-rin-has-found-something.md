Rin found something, and after a bit of struggling she finally managed to cut open the cellotape and pull open the cover flaps. I wonder whats inside... Let's follow Rin in and find out...

Woop... watch out!  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5112-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5112.jpg)  
  
Ow (O \_ O) Are you ok, Rin?  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5113-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5113.jpg)  
  
Oh it turns out she's fine. But lookie, she's pulled up the top bubble wrap. It looks like ARIA is written on the box. Huh? I don't remember ordering this...

Hmm. That won't work, Rin. I think you need a knife.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5115-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5115.jpg)  
  
Easy does it...  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5116-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5116.jpg)  
  
Phew. It must be pretty tiring for you. The packaging's pretty tough, it would've taken you all day to cut that open.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5117-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5117.jpg)  
  
Eh? Look! Haruhi and Tsuruya are coming here to help!  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5118-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5118.jpg)  
  
Shana's here too! Did she bring her uber sword along?  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5120-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5120.jpg)  
  
HEAVE!!! Oh c'mon Haruhi. YOU PULL TOO!

Alright! Sticking that knife there to hold it up was a good idea. Now to push it out of the box.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5124-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5124.jpg)  
  
Eh? Who's that up there? Saviour? He's back from his long journey to the Cosmic Era!  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5125-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5125.jpg)  
  
Ooh. He's gonna grab the box as it falls off the flap

Woopdiedoo

Awright! We got it out!  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5129-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5129.jpg)  
  
I wonder what's inside anyway.

Good thinking, Rin. Use a knife that's your size.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5132-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/03/wpid-100-5132.jpg)  
  
There we go, all the bubble wrap's almost completely taken off.

\*Rin slices the paper mache\* Mmmm. Hey! It actually looks like...

OMFG. ARIA COMPANY

Yes girls. You can play with them tomorrow.

To think, I have suddenly acquired ARIA Company. Is this destiny?
