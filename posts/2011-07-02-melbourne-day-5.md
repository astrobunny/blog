My first time making Omurice before going out for sunset at the beach<!--more--> [![](wp-uploads/2011/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0157-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2011/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0157.jpg)  
  
It was tasty too.

Sunset!

Melbourne's skyline in the distance. We will walk there from here after the sun sets.

Kagami and Tsukasa relax as the sun sets.

The sun's finally set and the girls are chilling out on the bag.

The skyline under the influence of a cross filter.

Akai discovers The Sign.

St Kilda's Marina. This is where you park your boat if you have one. There's even a tavern on the left side for sailors.

Approaching the city... well, sort of. We would have been walking for 4 hours straight towards the city from the beach.

I took this photo while waiting for the tram into the city.

After a long walk, we found ourselves outside another Japanese restaurant. This time we had Gyoza.

Some takoyaki

Fish

Ramen with Karaage

And some tonkotsu ramen for me. It didn't taste that awesome though. Nothing compared to the one in Auckland.

And downed it with some Plum Wine.

The shot tower in Melbourne Central. Apparently they just built a shopping complex and train station around the building. Epic.
