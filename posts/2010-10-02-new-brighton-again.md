My friend AkaiWolf came down to visit me so I decided to bring him to a nice beach since it was a nice day and we noticed the sky reflected on the wet sand.

There were people kiting at the beach.

Of course, Kagamin came too.

Someone built a stone age replica of the Torii gates too.

Enjoying the wind

Tsukasa on the logs.

Since the days are now warmer, there were lots of people making lots of things in the sand now.

Next we helped ourselves to dinner at Salt on the Pier, a restaurant overlooking the beach.

And we had some nice dessert.

Soon it was evening and we had to leave.

On the way out we saw the awesomely lit pier.
