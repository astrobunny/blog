After seeing some fanservice shots reading some review on Kaze no Stigma, I decided to try out watching this new anime. So I walked into my flatmate's room and had him get it, since he is in charge of the house's supply of anime. <!--more-->The conversation sorta went like this:  
  
astrobunny: Hey I want Kaze no Stigma  
ineser: I don't have it  
astrobunny: Can you download it?  
ineser: Why? Is it nice  
astrobunny: Its got this hawt girl with pink hair  
ineser: I like elves better.  
astrobunny: Its got lots of fanservice too  
ineser: Nah. Elves are the best. look for something with elves and we'll talk.  
astrobunny: C'mon hot girls are nice  
ineser: I say screw hot girls  
astrobunny: Exactly. That's why they are good  
Sly3r: Since when did you guys start talking about screwing elves?  
  
So after some persuasion, he decided to go with it and got 3 eps of it for me. Woot.  
  
Alright. So I watched the opening. Nothing to shout about really, just some slow downbeat song sung by average voices. It almost seemed as if the music was chosen only because it had the word "Wind" in it. (kaze means wind) So yeah, I guess the producers for this one weren't as lucky as Hayate no Gotoku. OR They did not have the budget to get an artist to write and sing a song specially for their anime. Either way, it wasn't the best opening, and a far cry from Lucky Star.

The story is about this girl, who, to my sad realization, was the only girl worth fapping to. Her skirt doesn't really help to hide her panties. Maybe she should try wearing shorts? (Thinks of Setsuna... ... ... \*splat nosebleed). I digress. She is the future lord of some Fire-controlling family that calls themselves the Kannagi. Well, when I said fire-controlling family, I mean it. These guys are crazy. They can call down fires to attack their enemies and burn them. I guess these people don't really need to carry lighters around. And this girl, Ayano, carries some very important sword called the Enraiha, which she uses (clumsily) to attack things out of impulse. Man, this girl's on fire.

Meanwhile there's this guy called Kazuma, which was also from the Kannagi, but was cast out because he couldn't use fire. LoL. Anyway, it seemed that he found some of these wind spirits and got lots of power from it, and became a wind-user, different from the rest of his original family which uses fire. Anyway, stuff and shit happens and people get killed when he is around. So this causes him to be blamed for a series of deaths in the family, including an assasination attempt on family members. Weird.

And, last of all, there is the guy's brother, who has a girl's voice and acts like a girl. I thought he was a girl. This fella has absolutely no trace of maleness in him. So you see Kazuma goes to some hotel and his brother looks for him there after sneaking out of the Kannagi compound. Then, his brother explains his situation and then tells him he can stay. His brother is overjoyed and... Whats up with the little heart shapes floating around his head!? weird.

Overall, its an okay anime with a reasonably okay plot. However, since its just the beginning I aint disappointed. What I would love to see would be the next few episodes where we were promised a proper amount of fighting and action. I really want to see what this fella Kazuma is capable of, apart from unceremoniously defeating his father in a very boring and very short duel. 3 episodes still leave much to be desired. Lets see how this goes.
