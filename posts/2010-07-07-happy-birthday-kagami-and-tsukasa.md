Today I bought a cake for the Hiiragi sisters to celebrate their birthday. We invited some close figmas to join the party too.

First off we went for some rememberance shots.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0216-500x752.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0216.jpg)  
  
Kagami was so happy and said its the first time I did it for her and was like "a...about time I got a cake. \>\_\>" Pff. Kagami, its for you AND your sister.

So first of all we decided to light up the cake, and Konata volunteered. But Kagami decided to veto that and said someone but Konata should do it.

So we got our in-house self-proclaimed pyrotechnician Kusakabe to do it for us.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0218-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0218.jpg)  
  
So now that the candles were lit, it was time to make wishes and blow it!

The cake looked awesome in the dark.

... until the paper wrapper started catching fire...  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0225-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0225.jpg)  
  
Then the letters started burning spontaneously  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0228-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0228.jpg)  
  
Before we knew it things were starting to get out of hand so I blew out the fire instead.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0230-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0230.jpg)  
  
We ended up with a burnt cake.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0233-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0233.jpg)  
  
And so our pyrotechnician fell from grace.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0231-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0231.jpg)  
  
It took a while to clean up the mess caused by the flames and wax.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0235-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/07/wpid-sml_DSC_0235.jpg)  
  
After that, we went off to complete the ritual by cutting the cake.

And had a great night with a fire to laugh about.
