Alright, so continuing from last week, we had Nagi's fianece come to see her, but had to escape some robots since he ain't welcome in the Sanzenin Mansion says Nagi. Anyway since everyone knows everyone now, we can move on to the next story.

Anyway, this spoilt brat boy is called Wataru Tachibana, and he has been bethrothed to Nagi, who obviously doesn't like that idea.

... and Nagi really wants to tell Hayate that he ain't her boyfriend. Somehow they start quarrelling and wake Isumi up, where we eventually discover that Wataru really like Isumi.

... in his dreams. However, when Hayate asks Isumi if she wants a Japanese style breakfast, she blushes and starts to stutter and pisses Wataru off. Wataru then challenges Hayate to a duel.

Not a wise decision since Hayate really can't be called human in terms of physical performance. But Hayate tries to "lose" and make everything right, but apparently he just caught more and more of Isumi's attention, which isn't really what was intended (=\_=.)

So in other words, we can safely wrap these relationships up and say that:

And so, the episode goes on with they now trying to get Nagi to apologize for making Wataru cry after the duel with Hayate. Nagi doesn't really want to but... Well I'll digress here for a while to say: WTFz0RZ! RICH PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT SUBWAYS ARE!? OMFG! THEY RIDE THE LIMO THAT OFTEN!?!? OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG.  
  
"So what do you see outside the window in a subway train? " -Isumi  
  
@\_@  
  
... Anyway, since Nagi heard about this new "subway" that she can ride on in the city, she happily agrees to go (not for apologizing to Wataru) to the city. (kids...)  
  
Oh and not only were Isumi and Nagi completely ignorant of the existance of intracity underground railways, Maria (to my surprise, also did not know that there ARE trains in the city other than the Shinkansen. rofl)

I did not realize Isumi had the power to get lost, but I sure wish some people had that :P. Just kidding. But during the search for Isumi, instead they become lost in some underground tunnel which they thought Isumi mistook for the subway. Apparently they were right, and saw Isumi there, but while being chased by rats, only to be saved by Isumi's creepy magic charm... @\_@... People with bodyguards from Osaka are strange.

Anyway, Hayate managed to help return some "rare" video tapes to Wataru, who owns a video store in Shinjuku and... well... Let me digress again. You see the person below?

This girl is full of crap. Basically, she (I don't know if there was pun intended, or she really didn't know the truth and she was making stuff up, but she) told Isumi that the subways go to Brazil. So she should "bring her passport".

So it turns out that Hayate's dad had been borrowing more than a hundred items from Wataru's store and never returning it, causing him to end up in even more debt. I wonder how he will deal with it this time... In a good way I suppose...
