Not too long ago (roughly 3 years) I wrote a simple little program that allowed me to spam this blog very quickly with posts from all sorts of anime. I decided that now I shall share it with everyone. BunnyBlogger is a blogging client that allows people to take snapshots from within the blogging client itself and post directly to their blog. It also features a live preview that updates while you write the HTML for your post.
