I've been doing a bit of practicing lately, by trying to draw stuff that's already been drawn by others. However, this picture has been around for ages, product of a sudden inspiration, and victim of sudden slackness. But now, I've finally taken the paper out back out of the dusty expanding file (yes. that's dust on my monitor. Spring cleaning is in order), scanned it, and re-lined it on the computer. Try guessing who the characters are. You can't call yourself a real anime fan if you don't know any of them.
