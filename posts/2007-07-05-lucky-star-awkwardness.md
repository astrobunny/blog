Ever wondered how it sucks to have someone who knows a better way of doing something than you do? When that person tells you the error of your ways, sometimes it just makes you feel really stupid. I don't know about all of you but it sure pisses me off. I've just had my first looks at 2 new anime episodes that just aired on Tuesday. Will blog about it in the next post. It seems, this season has got something to offer after all!
