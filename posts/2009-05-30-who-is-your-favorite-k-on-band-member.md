Is it Akiyama "moe moe kyun" Mio, Tanaka "Mio is Moe" Ritsu, Hirasawa "I am Senpai" Yui, Kotobuki "I luv Sawa-chan" Tsumugi or Nakano "IKEMASEN" Azusa? It is YOUR turn to decide. Vote for your favorite character, and the winning character will enjoy a nice tl;dr post of awesome and win of every form.
