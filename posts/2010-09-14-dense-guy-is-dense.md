Seriously? I'd wonder whats wrong with myself if I didn't know why the girl was having trouble concentrating with such strong uplifting wind.

Long shirt is long. Either that or her body is just short and her legs are very long.

"If she says she doesn't want to be your little sister, it means she wants to be your big sister!" Man that cracked me up. I didn't know she was a comedian too.

I thought this only happened in Gundam or Strike Witches ...

The problem with girls like this is that they are so cute you simply can't question their taste.

Amagami SS is great in the sense that its short and sweet, but one can't help but feel its over a bit too quick, and really just treats the girls like objects to fill you up with emotion, and are to be tried one after another. It is a nice breakaway from shows where the girl and guy never gets together. The best love stories still run along the lines of Itazura na Kiss in my opinion.
