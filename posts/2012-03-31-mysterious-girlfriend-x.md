It suddenly came to my attention that Mysterious Girlfriend X was going to air as anime starting [April 7th on Tokyo MX](http://www.starchild.co.jp/special/nazokano_x/onair/). Why is it such big news to me? Well, I've been busy, and I've been following the manga about the mystery of adolescence. Since I do not read a lot of manga I seldom get to experience the exhilaration of seeing black and white manga characters come to technicolor life. The last one I had was Mirai Nikki. And I enjoyed this manga.  
  
All I need now is a pair of scissors.
