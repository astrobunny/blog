Episode 4 seems to me like an episode used to confirm and set in stone what we already know about Kagami, Tsukasa, Konata and Miyuki Mio, Yui, Ritsu and Tsumugi. I must say that while the mizugi scenes weren't exactly arousing or anything to that effect, it was pretty much compensated for by Mio's incredible win and awesomeness. In this post, I'm going to adore and worship Mio in the first part, and then diss and rant about Ritsu and Yui and stress their levels of ignorance and retardedness this is just a picture post. Lots of Mio and lots Yui and Ritsu, if you swing that way, which, much as I'd hate to admit, just gives Mio to be more moe and loveable.

Concerned Mio. What really made my heart beat was not the mizugi, but Mio's plain girliness. I can't tell you any names of girls that are actually girly and concerned about others. I mean seriously, a lot of girls nowadays act like boys, which really make me feel like puking sometimes. They love to go "What the hell, man" and stuff. Its irritating and unladylike. Or maybe its just girls I know. Do you know girls that are like Mio?

I think also that, despite her generic look with the standard tsundere sharp eyes and blush, her jet black hair and eyes just tickle my asian love nerves for some reason.

So without making this post tl;dr, I'll just let you enjoy Mio now without making any more commentary.
