Today after her 'club activities' Haruhi wanted to wander off some more to search for supernatural phenomena. Although these exist, she always goes to the wrong places at the wrong time looking for ghosts, aliens and time travellers.

I'm not sure what she wanted to find from the top of the hills, perhaps it was so that she could spot UFOs or see more of the city to spot phenomena. Either way, I had just had to tag along. We started off at a little clearing off the road and took a trail up into the wilderness.

"To all brigade members: I am now scouting out vantage from which we can someday set up outposts for a supernatural phenomenon watch. All brigade members are expected to join in this activity when it begins."

She ended up having so much fun that she started taking pictures of things that didn't really matter when it came to hiking and sightseeing, like me.

We came up across some rocks we had to climb in order to get past. I was kinda worried that it would be too dangerous for Haruhi, but she wanted to do it anyway. It turns out she was planning to have me carry her up there all along.

She started sulking when I told her I was not going to. Spent a good half hour trying to appease her.

After we got over the rocks, Haruhi was all happy happy joy joy again. I wonder if she has any feelings for other people.

It turns out theres a port on the other side of the hills. I think that leads out to sea.

We also found a small spot. It seemed to be dedicated to the women pioneers of New Zealand or something.

It seems they have passed this place before.

Ooh. Pioneers.

She's having too much fun. I think she completely forgot about the supernatural search now.

If you were curious, that's Haruhi's camera.  
  
Do you live in a place where civilization was brought from overseas? Do you think your country would be better if it wasn't colonized?
