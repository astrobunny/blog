This time we see Birler's new dream of uniting the galaxy's vast distances to ease travel. It's a great idea. But won't it become like... crowded? I mean, the galaxy is so big and wide, that's why all of us have so much fun exploring it. If it was all in one place, it would just become boring and stuff. I wonder about the fold faults. Maybe people truly are frustrated with the fact that they still can't cut through the galaxy as they liked. But then again there's that special foldpack that Michael and Ranka used... Maybe we are seeing Birler's plan come to life?

_Deep in thought. This is what I'd like to be when I grow up._

Not too long ago Macross Frontier was struggling against a tiny Zerg Vajra skirmish, but now, it seems they are completely past it, and are dragging Vajra corpses. Corpses I tell you! That could come back to life the moment Ranka starts singing and wreak havoc on the entire subship! I personally think that they have lost it completely. Or have they?

Mina has an iris after all! Lol @ Ram for that comment. I'm sure she's starving for some nice deculture Vajra omelette or something.

Frontier still looks a mess after that intense Vajra attack 2 episodes ago. It seems that the President has got his work cut out for him. I wonder if they will be able to get back to normal anytime soon...

"For show and tell today, I bring you Brera Styrne. He is an android developed on Macross Galaxy and pilots the newest pink gay Valkyrie fighter. He saved my life once before from a very very bad chimera and is now my bodyguard... " \*Alto slams the table and jumps at Brera "I FUCKING TOLD YOU NOT TO MESS WITH MY GIR..."

You know, I hope someday Steve Jobs will make the iPhone like this. It will simply swallow UMD's or miniCD's or whatever, and I can pull out a leg as an earphone to listen to it play. I would also love to be able to squeeze it to answer a call. Oh man... STEVE PLEASE MAKE ONE OF THESE PLEASE! CALL IT THE iFROG or something I DON'T CARE!

Man seriously, after that Vajra attack, Frontier looks like Kosovo on a good day.

Its amazing how cute a baby Vajra is. You'd love to cuddle with it, love it, go all huggles and smoochiez with it, until it becomes an adult... Then you'd wish you had an Autocannon or something.

Who thinks Ranka's signature should be on their T-shirt? Put your hands up in the air put your hands up in the air put your hands up in the air.

OhmyGawd, Sheryl is in dere mode now. Woot. Gotta love it when french girls go completely dere, Japanese style. Now if only Alto found his man card.

VF-25 $160 million, quarter bunk, $12,000, Alto banging head on Michael's bunk, priceless.  
There are somethings money just can't buy. For everything else, there's a Sheryl and a Cathy super-duper surprise callup.

Yes. That's it, you can't let Cathy see her, or she'll become a Vajra too.

I wonder why Brera gets the awesomely cool Valkyrie with the full-immersion virtual reality cockpit? Is that something they developed on Galaxy? Damn I need one of those.

Did you ever notice that the Macross Quarter's main deck was designed like Asterix's hat? Yes. It looks pretty cool but still...
