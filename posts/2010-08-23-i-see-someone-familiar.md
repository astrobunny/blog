Hey guys, did you notice the guy standing next to Yamanaka Sensei Sawa-chan-sensei?

Well, it's not like I'm really acquainted to him or anything but, doesn't he look astonishingly like Kagami's dad?  
  
Maybe K-ON is set in a period of time several years before Lucky Star, when one of Kagami's elder sisters attended Sakuragaoka High.
