Haruhi's Back. God's Back, along with the alien, the time traveller and the esper. However, the magic that accompanied her and her little brigade wasn't there anymore. Perhaps the hype died after waiting for such a long time, or perhaps it takes a while for it to build back up again... It is interesting enough however, to think an ordinary series with no special effects and just short explanations of random paranormal occurrences would create enough energy to garner a following akin to religion.

I'm not sure how many of you feel the same way, but when I was watching this episode, I searched deep and hard for those feelings that used to engulf me when I managed to get my hands on the next episode after a week of waiting...

And when Haruhi would come up with something random...  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/05/wpid-haruhi-2-01-2-500x283.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/05/wpid-haruhi-2-01-2.jpg)  
  
Or when I saw Nagato, reading as if nothing was happening around her...

It would wash away all the melancholy.

After 2006 ended, somehow the feelings persisted, and I continued to anticipate the second season, desperately thirsting for more

I turned to other things to fill in the gaping hole left where the magic used to reside

But I somehow still longed for something far greater. Nothing in the world showed me anything anywhere near what Haruhi could produce.

But somehow... despite Haruhi's return being similar to the return of a long lost relative...

It didn't feel like anything special anymore.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/05/wpid-haruhi-2-01-42-500x283.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/05/wpid-haruhi-2-01-42.jpg)  
  
Perhaps its time this love affair ended...

Or perhaps I should write my longings on little strips of paper and hang them up on the Bamboo tree outside.

Till then, I'm still glad Haruhi's back.

Its been a while.
