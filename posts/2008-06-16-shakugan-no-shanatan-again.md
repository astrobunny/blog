Our cute chibi manifestation of ultra-tsundere moeness is back to haunt away the evil tomogaras. I must admit, Shakugan no Shanatan, although a short and random series of spinoffs, is a stroke of genius. God I just love it when Kazumi goes into WTF mode. Genius. Absolute genius. Ok. fine. I'm late. But HEY, at least somebody's got a life to speak of.

I'm sure everyone remembers how Kazumi always stalks Shana and Sakai and goes "YAPPARI KOROSU" and goes into a rage frenzy. Well, the tradition continues here with Kazumi hiding behind each lamp post that is reserved for her use. Talk about being prepared...

Though, I completely went WTF when I saw that Ike is following in Kazumi's footsteps. Like, literally.

I'm sure they thought of this years ago, but I still went WTF anyway since the wanderer was enjoying his orgasmic reload just seconds before he falls into slumberland and completely lost his wood. I mean, c'mon man, what about the ladies? No wonder Shana burned it to death. Its bubble really makes one wonder what its made of.

In Fumina Strikes Back, this is pure ROFL material. Sabrac the Assasin teaches Shana's class about the flaming tidal wave, and likens it to putting three daggers into a washing machine and turning it on. Sabrac in this picture really really looks like Kakashi. See those eyes? I bet they are Sharingan.

And I realized that Kazumi plays twister on her own. I wonder if she does anything else on her own. It makes me wonder how much of a stupid fool Sakai is. I mean, I'm sure he'll get anything from Kazumi if he just asked nicely. Not that I'm making any examples but you know what I mean. This girl is obviously taking a one way trip to the Xander Zone. [That aside, Shana has put on her most amazing performance yet. The Melon Pan Technique! I wish I could train my cells to be bakers as well to be able to do this.](/images/wp-uploads/2008/06/shanashoot.swf)

Of course, the show wouldn't finish without a nice big parody coming from JC Staff themselves on the biggest internet phenomenon yet.  
  
More screencaps for your fapping viewing pleasure.
