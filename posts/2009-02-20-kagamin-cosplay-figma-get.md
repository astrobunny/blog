It has recently come to my attention that Good Smile Company is in charge of building the latest object of my dreams. Kagami cosplaying Hatsune Miku could just become the fastest selling figma on record. [Kagamin's popularity](http://www.japanator.com/elephant/post.phtml?pk=8835) is no longer held to doubt as the tsundere, who finds akiba-keis profoundly repulsive, has been forced to cosplay another recent digital idol known as Hatsune Miku

All I can say is that Miku's style suits her well. Since she already is a natural twintailer, mixing in Miku's bright techno-punk colours just adds to the charm already overflowing from the intense moeness of Kagamin.

Now well beyond speculation, this figma may just be the most anticipated figma yet among the throes of Lucky Star and Hatsune Miku worshippers.
