Lol. Moe factors. Moe (more-eh) is basically means "infatuating" in Japanese. It means like... fascinating in a girl-is-arousing sense. Moe-factor then translates to factors that make people aroused. I don't find Miyuki THAT arousing coz she's a comic character, but I do agree with Konata on that one. I love blur girls. They just act so cute! On the subject of weaknesses, yes I do have moments when I feel certain people have absolutely no weaknesses at all. They are so perfect you'd hate yourself for liking them. Ugh. And I really hated looking at my position on the results lists back in school. Makes me feel so small.
