Itazura 9 is win, but for a very different reason. It's not because of moe girls or fanservice, but this time its win because a guy just dumped a dung-ugly girl. GO IRIE! DUMP THE TRAMP. Serves Matsumoto right for trying to steal Irie from Kotoko. That bimbo-ish-sad-excuse-for-a-girl-nerd needs to be dumped in almost every way possible before she realizes the difference in the quality of Kotoko's affection and hers.

Poor Kotoko has it bad with the tennis club. Her club exec just keeps pushing her up and past her limits, and she's got the racket mark to prove it. Having been hit by an incoming tennis volley from the coach and getting riled up by Mugsumoto just worsens her day everyday, but that doesn't stop her from being innocently cute.

As a matter of fact, she just gets more and more likeable all the time. The fact that she's the victim all the time, and always trying so hard to do everything right just makes everyone like her. I'm not sure how open minded intelligent people are but they sure are very very blind to these things. Maybe this world is ruled by"dumb" people after all.

Rofl. Metal Hearts. Someone needs to collect all these pieces of gold and put them together in the Lourve of weird names made up by Japanese people. The world needs more popular outlets like Starbugs and Burger Queen.

Ok, I digress. Back to KotokoVision, we see her imagination running wild like a giraffe on the Kalahari. I must say this one really threw me off my seat laughing, at the same time, my neurons held a gathering with the very big words written "AWWWWW" on the walls of the agora. All of her mess-ups and pitiful stances only led to me ending up rooting for her. After all, she's the one who tried the hardest.

Of course, the incident at the cinema also proves that she ain't so dumb after all, after an ingenius tactic of putting a magazine between Matsumoto and Irie from preventing the bimbo from lying on Irie's shoulders, one would find that Kotoko can really use her head when she needs it.

This just looks off-putting. But of course, one couldn't help but ROFL at the situation.

Finally, Kotoko gets some well-deserved quality time with Irie. This is the first time I've actually felt happy for characters in a romance show. But this one really brought Kotoko's heart out nonetheless. Let's see if her "zettai happy ni naru kara" wish will come true.
