Hi all regular visitors of my blog. I'm sure you guys have noticed the recent lack of posts recently. Well, I've been struggling to keep up with my own schedule lately and I've been working late into the nights trying to make deadlines. Real life has really become that much more of an adventure I feel I'm losing my life as a hikikomori. It may be a blessing in disguise however. Anyway, I am in the process of revising my calendar to cope with this lifestyle change and I'm trying to get my priorities straight, since I have some new ones. But I need some feed back on my daily comic run. What do you guys think? Should I continue translating and providing 4komas every day? Or should I feature something else on my site?
