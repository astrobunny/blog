Would you like to go on a date?

Hmm?

Araragi always seems to be in some sort of deep shit with Hitagi.

I guess this is the true reason why this series is called a monster story.

Do you love me?

Say you love me or I shall let you experience hell. (This sounds very familiar.)

What happens when you mix hopelessness with a person? (if you don't understand this go watch the earlier episodes)

You pronounce this kanji: "Araragi".

Father, Araragi is in love with you. (Goddamn SHAFT, where do you get your inspiration from!?)

You're getting boring again. Warning: low motivation will put you closer to hell.

I can't believe you said those horrible things.

Hey trash, I mean Araragi. Whats up with you tonight? Constipated?

Or did you want something you're not supposed to havE?

Japan is probably the only place left in the world besides the former british colonies where people drive on the wrong side of the road.

If you failed the test things would've been funnier

Or was it your intention to disappoint me by not disappointing me?

Just for the sake for fulfilling the title we might as well talk about her a little.

Hitagi always looks so bored.

I wonder what she meant by "shattering his norms and standards"? Perhaps we will only find out in the impending doujin stampede.

I wonder why trees exist. To block out the sun? Or to block out the stars?

Daddy, you are not allowed to peek. Even if we did this thing and that thing, you are NOT allowed to peek.

Ok. Enough talk from me. Bakemonogatari is just this awesome. In Hitagi's words, I lack the vocabulary to describe the emotion that has put a heavy impression on me resulting from watching this show. Please enjoy the rest of the pictures and try and spot Altair, Deneb and Vega.
