In truth I just wanted to show off my Science Railgun postcard that came with A Certain Limited Figma. I've been keeping this in my box of treasures for a while now, just taking it out once in a while to stare at Misaka. Railgun has advanced so much in awesomeness that it has reached the level of possibly entering my list of unforgettable shows which includes ARIA and Lucky Star.
