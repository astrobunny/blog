I agree with Fate and Nanoha. Ushio really is cute. She is the cutest thing ever since Mei-chan in CLANNAD. One comes to wonder if all anime, solemn or not, intentionally or not, is doomed to have some kind of harem involved, and a harem for one guy at that. And the worst part is, the guy doesn't know how lucky he is. This post is only about Ushio btw, and is just a collection of images for those who are inclined to stare deep into our newborn heroine's eyes.

Ushio really looks like her mother, Nagisa. But this tomboyish girl is nowhere near as weak. She's as strong as piece of steel, being able to hold tears in in the most difficult of times. Truly a hero for her age. On a side note, Ushio really doesn't look anything like Tomoya. I wonder what she got from him...

Love for toys? Nope.

Puppy look? Nope.

Stubbornness? Perhaps...

One thing's for sure, she really does look like Nagisa. And I doubt anyone could resist those puppy eyes.

So cute. The thing is, no matter how little Ushio looks like Tomoya, they still look no less than family with each other for some reason. Its amazing how quickly Ushio warmed up to Tomoya after all these years spent away from him.

This scene reminds me of Kanon. Kyoto Animation is trying to make a statement here. If you want to draw good, you should start with the evenings.

Ushio is truly Nagisa's daughter.

I think she could say 'anpan' and make a country fall in love with her.

I mean look at her! Don't you wish YOUR kids were like this?
