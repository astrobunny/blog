A bandaged Ayanami has appeared! I wonder if I should rescue her and make her fall in love with me. そんなわけないだろう。(TL: there's no way that could happen). Of course, she would stay emotionless and distant and look at you with unfocused eyes. She seems to be sleeping soundly right now. I wonder if I should wake her up.

Oh she's up. Man she's so cute even when she's injured. Her plugsuit still reeks of the bloody smell of LCL, and EVA-00 has been taken back into the MaiReume GeoFront for repairs. I'm guessing its because the plugsuit wasn't cleaned before the LCL has dried, thats why her suit is still all shiny and stuff.

The Revoltech Fraulein Ayanami Rei Bandaged ver. is quite the photogenic one. For one thing, the bandages on her arms allow great opportunities to hide the joints, and to create clever joint shapes that actually look natural. But unfortunately Revoltech isn't exactly as well-versed in the art of making action figures of humans, and so still show flaws from its in inexperience. Even so, the figure still looks pretty damn good on photo.

One of the things that I was really interested in asking the makers of this fraulein is, why the shiny suit? It puzzled me, so I made up that thing about dried LCL on her suit for the sake of making up an excuse. If you were involved in making the frauleins, please tell me!

Rei's angry at me for looking at pictures of other girls, and starts pointing her blue lance at me.

Oh no, Asuka, not you too...

The defence of moe.

My camera skills aren't as good today.

Rei's tired. Let her rest. She already maimed an angel today after Wimpari Shinji was wimping out in Unit 01.

Yeah. I'll just sit here all day...

Blue lighting ftw.

Trustworthy companions.

Nice figure overall. True to the Revoltech style. The best Frauleins are still the ones from Evangelion. I didn't really like what they did with the Haruhi characters. The reason they probably had these better is because they are in plugsuits. I wonder if they'll make a Rei Ayanami in uniform. I'll snap it up like a crocodile if they ever did.
