For those of you in the south, here's a friendly reminder that there aren't many days of summer left, so make sure you make the most of it while you can! Or you can migrate like the birds and go to Japan where the next summertime is going to be held this year. Stop sitting at home watching anime and go outside and break some watermelons!
