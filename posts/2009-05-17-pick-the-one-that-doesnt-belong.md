Yes. I'm ranting about artwork here. What do you think of the newly designed character? I think its just a load of sexual crap. The plugsuit looks like 2 hands touching her breasts and the suit breaks away from the more simplistically styled original plugsuits that Rei and Asuka wear, and has extra frills which shouldn't even be there. Not to mention the new character looks like she's from a totally different anime. I wonder if the movie is going to be polluted by this girl like a glaring ball of light that was pasted half-heartedly onto an otherwise legendary harmonic collage of emotion, action and evangelion.
