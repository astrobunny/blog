Alright. So I met this nice guy on IRC who told me that my BG was buggy. Yeah. I'm sure all of you noticed now. It's not the two blue stripes anymore. It's fixed. Anyway, check out his [blog](http://tokidoki.animeblogger.net/). He blogs about anime when they come out and gives his opinions on it and whether it's worth watching or not. A good place to start if you wanna know whether or not some new thing on fansub.tv is good or not, or if you are an aspiring hikikomori/otaku.
