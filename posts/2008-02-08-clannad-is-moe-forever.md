One of the biggest reasons I watch CLANNAD and ignore the really weird and random story (or lack thereof) is the fact that it is made my KyoAni. And this automatically means that the girls in the show are moe. And they are not just moe. They are moe to the MAX.  
  
First of all, I'd love to talk about the Fujibayashi twins. They are pure win. Like epic win. They must be born of angels, and are too good to be true. Though there are twins like them around they still qualify to be one of the 7 wonders of human genetics if they really existed.
