"Gawd. Why'd they have to keep these huge and dangerous animals as pets?" says Nagi.   
"I don't understand either, since they are alll huge and dangerous" says Maria.  
  
It was, and still is amazing and shocking how often people ignore the elephant/tiger in the room. If I didn't know better I'd say this is satire for real life. An example comes out of the internet and webmaster talk itself. Many people talk about SEO (Search Engine Optimization for those of you who aren't so inclined) of their websites. They hold conferences and talk about Yahoo, Google and Microsoft's search engines. The thing is, when people talk about search engines, they really only mean one thing. Google.  
  
The fact that Google dominated this side of the internet so completely and so quickly is something most people cannot yet fathom. It's so great, so overpowering, like how dubs are so horrible, that it is in the rebellious nature of humans to deny it. No one really wants to admit it. But when I say search engine, the first thing that comes to mind, is Google no matter where you live.
