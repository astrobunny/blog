This week the student council faces a tremendous adversary in the form of a cute, unassuming child of a wealthy family. Unbeknownst to them, her intentions in coming to the meeting are far more sinister than what appears to be mere a child taking up important official school time.

First of all, she is here to invoke the long pent up emotions of jealousy in our infinitesimal student council president by making Sugisaki dote on her.

Due to her need for serious parent-like attention, our Yaya-chan-chara-change-alike is challenged with the notion of having a girl on Sugisaki's side.

She is also an accomplished actress. Merely using a moustache, she can recreate the all-but-generic scenes from various detective movies.

She is also practised in the fine arts of creating replays of classic media headlines. A trait unmistakably learned from her journalist sister.

She is also highly skilled in ayatori, or cat's cradle, where one manipulates strings to create forms in the likeness of bridges and abstract art. She however, redefines the limits on ayatori and recreates what one can only speculate to be a form of popular lingerie.

Not satisfied with merely winning shimapan enthusiasts to her support, she shows Sugisaki the principles of the universe using the same strings to win over all the intellects and physicists who struggle for years in vain only to bow to failure in the quest for the truth.

She also demonstrates incredible prowess in staring games where she uses a questionable technique related to her size and nature to cause the opponent to lose.

Fortunately, our valiant president decides that she should prevent the imminent destruction of the council by facing off against her in a battle of intelligence and wit...

At last, she returns home in glory, victorious over even those who have lived longer than her, and even decides to take with her a trophy of her conquests. She chooses the valedictorian to emphasize the weight of her actions on the school's history and attempts to lure him by proposing to him.

Truly a fearsome adversary. This is perhaps why children are not allowed in high level company meetings and official gatherings.
