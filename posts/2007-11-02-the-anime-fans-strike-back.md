Once again, the Anime Fan Music Contest returns with an awesome new selection of songs from fanboys and fangirls waving their anime fandom flamboyantly in front of the Internet. Feast your ears on fan-sung versions of anime songs created by those not content with only listening and watching anime characters. Aspiration is a great thing, but I find that what makes what we do complete all the fun we had joining this contest! Go to [bj0rN's blog now and VOTE](http://bj0rn.animeblogger.net/2007/11/01/afm-season-2-voting-begins/ "Bj0rN's AFM Post") to vote for your favorite song! Make your opinion count and be part of a show to the world that anime rules at AFM2: THE COMEBACK.
