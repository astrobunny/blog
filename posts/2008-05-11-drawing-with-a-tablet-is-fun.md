Shana's got a new friend now.  
  
I bought myself a tablet today. Its a Wacom Bamboo tablet. I always wanted to draw stuff on to a screen but no matter how sensitive, a mouse just does not cut it. It simply doesn't beat the sensation of using a pen that frees your head into concentrating on drawing instead of actually trying to get the mouse to move in the right direction.  
  
Anyway, after a little test, I decided to to see if the tablet could get my l33t drawing (I wish) skillz from the paper to the digital world. So this is the first complete picture I have drawn with a digitising tablet. I call it "Confession".
