 ![](wp-images/old/albums/random/girl.JPG)Alright. So I was walking by ineser's room today and heard some "dungam gundam" sounds and decided to check it out. Looks like he got his hands on some new anime again. However, this one was pretty special. For one thing, its got a really \*cough\*catchy name. I mean, (I'm gonna rant now) WTF IS KISS DUM!? When I first heard the name I was like LMAO and ROFL and OMGWTFBBQ and all the abbreviations related to surprise, shock and strangeness. I'm gonna jump the guy who gave that name to an anime I mean seriously... before I heard that I thought Manabi Straight was a bad name, or Hidamari Sketch or something like that, but seriously this one jumped right to the top of my WTF list. I guess an era is coming where all anime will have at least one English, or European word in it.<!--more-->  
  
 ![](wp-images/old/albums/random/robot.JPG)Anyway, on to the review. At first sight, it doesn't look that bad, until I noticed how fast paced the story was. In the first episode, they managed to tell story of what was going on, do a major battle over Tokyo, and kill a main character AND revive him again. All in one episode. The story is about a certain "Book of Death" which doesn't even look like a book to me, and death? Well, hell it just revived someone so no comment. It started off showing a really strange creature that hit a ship and caused all its passengers to die Titanic-style in the sea. Then, years later an exploration team went to have a look at the wreck, and sure enough traced some strange evolution going on in the sea.  
  
 ![](wp-images/old/albums/random/shu.JPG)So then this girl comes along and shows us her built-for-fanservice wreck Haruka style (bonus points if you get what I mean) and stands beside what I think is a scientist attempting to trace the journey of the Book of Death, which had triggered unusual evolution in some sea creatures and gave them breasts and legs and stuff. Soon, the scientist puts her hand in some very eewy glue and pulls out a fish with a huge ass mouth. Very sick indeed and I don't intend to show this here because if you have a weaker stomach than mine, chances are you won't feel very good about looking at it. Some people on the other hand think its cute.  
  
 ![](wp-images/old/albums/random/bakemono.JPG)Soon, a big bug problem comes around in the form of a locust-like infestation. AKA, a large swarm of bugs swarm up the entire Tokyo and ships, causing havoc all over the place. Not only that, the bugs start to group together and manifest strange large creatures and drop them out of the sky, which in turn destroy lots of buildings and create a Godzilla situation in Tokyo. After this comes the fun part. The armed forces start intervening and send out their most high tech equipment. They then release an inmate called Shuu and sends him piloting a craft to the city to fight monsters.  
  
 ![](wp-images/old/albums/random/tohn.JPG)Overall, it looks like a world-crisis sci-fi anime that has got elements of Robotech and Gundam in it as well as some lolis and moeness to fill the gaps in. There is also some romance that has already budded, I see in this anime. Minmei-Roy Fokker style perhaps? And lots of tech involved too. Overall, still doesn't look too bad, and we have got a highly tsuntsun commander running the show with the military. A tsundere candidate perhaps? We'll never know till we find out in the next few episodes!  
  
p.s. The last picture is a boy.
