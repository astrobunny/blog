OMG now I realized just how much time I sit at home watching silly anime episodes all day. I ain't fit in any sense at all! This afternoon and morning was spent up at Mount Hutt snowboarding. I must admit its still only one of the first few times I've snowboarded. 3 times last year? Fuh. Nothing to bring me up to speed. I fell a million times today and my butt hurts. Looks like I'm built to be a hikkikomori after all... Here are a few pictures for you to see what I was looking at all day. Yes. it's snow duh. I think everyone will agree that my ability to take photographs is on par with my ability to snowboard.
