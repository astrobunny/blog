Just as the title says... I have my life back! YAY! Software Assignment Kanryou! And me and friends went to Osakaya to have dinner today. I treated myself to a large helping of Teriyaki Chicken and Pork Okonomiyaki. Wonderful stuff. I was too busy eating and my camera was at home so I didn't manage to take photoes. Sorry! But here's a nice big image of Fate Testarossa to get you guys worked up while I go catch up on 2 days of sleep.
