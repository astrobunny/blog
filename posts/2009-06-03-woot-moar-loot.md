Today Nagato and Kyonko noticed a certain anomaly in the room. Looks like Haruhi is getting bored and invoking her powers again.

Our Goddess Nagato is finally here. Since I haven't done a review in a while, I might just do a review on something tomorrow. What would you guys like to know about these figures? Help me choose one of the figmas or Nagato to review first.
