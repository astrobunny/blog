New anime figures come out almost daily. Some that I recognize and some that I don't. Some are quite nice, some are fugly as the bird goo that dropped on my car a few days ago. However, anime figures have recently caught my eyes, as some of them are actually quite good-looking. They almost bring the character to life. The four pictures of this post are pictures of figures from Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu. And God they look frigging awesome.

What really makes me excited about these figures is the detail that goes into them. The sculptors manage to get the materials on the figure just right, with the right levels of reflectivity and gloss. This makes for clothes that actually look like clothes, and sparkling eyes. Just look at Nagato. The eyes are highly reflective plastics, that make for very nice reflections indeed. They make them look as if they were actually reflecting light. Giving the bright eyes effect. The shirt gets a 9/10 for me. The 9 for the mad attention to the wrinkles and texture of the shirt. The -1 was just the fact that it looked a bit more like plastic that cloth, I think they could do better.

Now, what's even better that releases on the main characters of the anime, is releases of it's supporting characters too! I, personally have the tendency to like supporting characters in an anime better. I'm not sure why it's just who I am. I'm all for Asakura. (not that my personality is anywhere near hers) . It would be nice if Max Factory made more characters from Negima too, and based off the awesome art from Negima!?. If they did, I'll get myself a part time job just for these figures, instead of staying at home doing useless stuff like installing OS X on a PC and writing PHP scripts that I always throw away.

Every otaku would aspire to collecting all the figures related to the characters in the world of anime. As Konata puts it, it's called "LOVE". I would do it though, if my budget weren't that tight. Though having access to anime and manga is already quite a blessing in itself, it would be nice to have one or two of those figurines lying/standing around. Being a scholar in modern days is better. Bitter, but still better. The debate goes on in my head however, as to whether or not I should get one of them? Just to keep my Saviour Gundam company? What do you think?
