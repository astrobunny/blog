Oh my God I just realized it's Friday the 13th today. WHOA. I was actually lucky nothing bad happened. Why in the world is Friday the 13th considered unlucky anyway? I heard that it had something to do with Black Friday and the number 13. Speaking of which, I came across this little poem today.  
  
One in Fire Two in Blood  
  
Three in Storm Four in Flood  
  
Five in Anger Six in Hate  
  
Seven Fear Evil Eight  
  
Nine in Sorrow Ten in Pain  
  
Eleven Death Twelve Life Again  
  
Thirteen Steps to the Dark Man's Door  
  
Won't be turning back no more  
  
Those are the Devil's steps. I love it when I read poems like these. Anyway, Happy Friday the 13th! May all your good luck charms work! \*touches wood.
