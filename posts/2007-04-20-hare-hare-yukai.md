Suzumiya Haruhi&nbsp;is&nbsp;officially being worshipped by people from "all walks of life", as us AZNs would say it, and with the Hare Hare Yukai being danced by boys and girls from the east to west, if 1 YouTube Vid would spring out from every 100 occurences of a craze, then Haruhi, in the Pop culture, or rather OTAKU culture sense, is a God, as pronounced by Itsuki. (no I disclaim saying that she is a true God, or that God is a Girl[Otakus, plz don't stalk me])&nbsp;Well, I, who so happens to be one of the guys at the side watching this craze go on, has found a few youtube videos of rather creative versions of the Hare hare yukai. Yes. There are many super, hyper, ultra bad videos on youtube, estimated to be in the thousands. I assure you, these videos have been hand picked by sessha to for your entertainment. Enjoy.
