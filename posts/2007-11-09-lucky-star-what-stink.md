What stink?

  
I'm sure all of you have watched Lucky Star and wondered how everytime they start a scene with a conversation already going on, Kagami and friends would usually be talking about something that "stinks". Every time one of the episodes have this sort of scene, I go back to bed and wonder "what in the world is that stink anyway?", and find it hard to sleep.  
  
What exactly is this "stinking thing anyway?" What could possibly be the "shit" that Kagami and friends so happened to be talking about everytime we start looking at them? It gets even more suspicious. Why do they stop immediately once the scene begins and changes the subject? Maybe it's Kagamin's cake.

Finally, in episode 23, it starts to smell good. What do you guys think stinks anyway? Could it be this:
