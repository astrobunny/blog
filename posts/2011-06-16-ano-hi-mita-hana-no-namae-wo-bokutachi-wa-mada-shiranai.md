I'm late to the show, but this show's pretty awesome. It's about the lives of a boy who's struggling to let go of his past, except a ghost continues to haunt him about it. It's actually pretty decent and touches on some very interesting bits of how people feel about their childhood, nostalgia and past lives.<!--more--> [![](wp-uploads/2011/06/wpid-gg_Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_o_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai_-_01_4AB675D1_5-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2011/06/wpid-gg_Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_o_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai_-_01_4AB675D1_5.jpg)  
  
The show's mostly about Jinta who's a middle schooler that isn't attending school, and a ghost from his past, Menma. While he thinks he's hallucinating, (which is actually probably how one would define this anyway), he continues to act as if she's around even in the presence of other people.

Jinta's not going to school seems to be a huge source of distress for the unfortunately named Anaru, who's apparently madly in love with Jinta.

Another strange couple is what appears to be top-class students from a very good school, also part of Jinta's gang when they were children.

And this huge fella, who seems to be the "Little John" of the group.

Apparently this show shows how the group come to grips with growing up and loss as they relive the childhood memories they had growing up together in the same town.

The most awesome surprise coming out of this show was, however actually a re-release of Zone's old hit Kimi ga Kureta ~secret base~. It was such an old song I was surprised to see it in this show.
