After a short night's sleep we woke up to the fresh smell of K-ON and hotel room to start our day.

Next we headed down into town to find a karaoke place that we were supposed to meet up at.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0503-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0503.jpg)  
  
And then we sang for eight hours.

Kagami had fun too.

Yes that's basically all we did all day before I jumped on another jet plane to land in Malaysia.

The next morning me and Kagami decided to have a look around our local spaceport apartment. Turns out there's a nice swimming pool.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0523-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0523.jpg)  
  
And badminton courts! Great places to keep fit.

And a cafe to provide food for those activities.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0535-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0535.jpg)  
  
There's a little flower garden too! We will have to do a photoshoot here sometime.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0537-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0537.jpg)  
  
And there was a nice playground for Kagami to run around in.

There were also some courts for those more inclined to play with balls.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0542-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0542.jpg)  
  
We decided to hang out at the pool for a bit to cool off in the tropical heat.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0550-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0550.jpg)  
  
But ended up playing in the water.

View of the area from upstairs. Note that the Zentraedi-sized piano was actually built for the purposes of entertaining our giant guests once, but nowadays its form is less functional and more as a source of aesthetic appeal. Our giant friends have also gone to less heavily populated micronian areas to entertain themselves.

View of Kuching City from the tower with Mount Santubong in the background. Legend has it that a fallen titan fell to earth and became the soil that formed that mountain. Hence the face-like shape of the mountain.

After a long hot walk under the sun, we decided to take a break and chill out with nice cold drinks.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0596-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0596.jpg)  
  
It also turned out our stowaway was an impostor all along. HIIRAGI!

And Reimu just drinks too much... even in this hot weather.
