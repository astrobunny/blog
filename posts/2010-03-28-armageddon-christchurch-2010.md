This year's Armaggeddon in Christchurch actually had a queue comparable to Auckland's! It was so long it took people half and hour to get from the back of the queue to the front. They need more counters!  
 Day 2 is [here](http://www.astrobunny.net/2010/03/28/armageddon-christchurch-2010-2/)

We even spotted a cute Yuna on the way to the line

What the line looked like from the back

Yes. Pedobear came too. He even offered free hugs. How nice.

And then there's the staple bleach cosplay.

There were North High uniforms too!

When you enter the door the first thing you see is the cushion fighting thingy. Though, I'm only interested in cosplay here so this will be a cosplay post.

There was a Haruhi... I think...

And the usual storm trooper costumes again. I think they are kinda selling this stuff ...

These guys here are lining up for autographs from dub voice actors. Though, I'm not exactly sure why people like dubs..

  

[![](wp-uploads/2010/03/wpid-sml_DSC_0831-500x752.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/03/wpid-sml_DSC_0831.jpg)

  

I even spotted a firefox in the hall!

She was even holding a globe!

Oh my.. Pedobear impostor?! What does this mean exactly!?

We even saw wolverine. This one was a really nice cosplay, even though it didnt look like, authentic.

Saw someone in a ZAFT suit. Not sure who he was supposed to be though.

I didn't realize captain 4 was a girl.

The place was so full of cosplayers it was good. It even made me feel like coming as someone next time. Honestly, the cosplay here is somehow better than anywhere else in NZ I've seen so far

  

[![](wp-uploads/2010/03/wpid-sml_DSC_0875-500x752.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/03/wpid-sml_DSC_0875.jpg)

  

Pleated skirts for the win.

We even had an awesome captain with bird in head.

There were even like, monsters. They were really good, I just didn't know where they were from.

  

[![](wp-uploads/2010/03/wpid-sml_DSC_0890-500x752.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/03/wpid-sml_DSC_0890.jpg)

  

Vampire hunters came too.

Of course, Kagami was happy that there were so many cosplayers to see too.

  

[![](wp-uploads/2010/03/wpid-sml_DSC_0901-500x752.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/03/wpid-sml_DSC_0901.jpg)

  

Pretty. Not sure from where. I think I'm pretty out of touch with the shows popular in the west now...

  

[![](wp-uploads/2010/03/wpid-sml_DSC_0902-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/03/wpid-sml_DSC_0902.jpg)

  

Asuka was playing with Kagamin for a while too!

Auron was here too

  

[![](wp-uploads/2010/03/wpid-sml_DSC_0932-500x752.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/03/wpid-sml_DSC_0932.jpg)

  

And so was... frog-tan!

  

[![](wp-uploads/2010/03/wpid-sml_DSC_0935-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/03/wpid-sml_DSC_0935.jpg)

  

It really felt like there was a Mikuru in the audience.

After hunting down all the cosplayers, we went off to watch the ice cream eating competition, and get ice creams that were thrown into the crowd. And then there was a random Kamehameha contest where someone peed on stage, which was awful. More on that later. Watch out for day 2!
