If I didn't know better, Kotomi has been developed pretty well in the CLANNAD series. Finally ending a spell of sleepiness when I'm watching recent anime. Shana has gotten boring with all the love-love jealousy and righteousness antics, and CLANNAD finished off the Fuuko part so all of a sudden there seems to be nothing that is worth watching, and Myself;yourself seems to be going down the road of the nice boat. Not all is lost however, Kotomi-chan is here to save the day! ... or break it in some cases.

There goes Sunohara... one more brave soldier lost in the call of duty. Being a playboy really is tough.

Of course, these animals will forever be remembered down the history of anime. Brave Puhi and brave Meow.

When it comes to moeness, most girls in anime radiate moeness. So theres no question to what Kotomi is, moe or not. The thing is, what kind of moeness the girl exhibits? I am hard pressed to classify them, but I would say Kotomi has the "man what's wrong with everybody" moeness.

Of course, every girl must have the Blush() function. It is the very thing that invokes the moeness of a girl to its fullest. Here's to Kotomi starting to grow on Tomoya.

Man, I don't see how any man inside an anime wouldn't give his life to see something like this every day and night. KyoAni really knows how to draw wonderful portraits.

Kotomi is a very nice girl and very shy. You must treat her gently or else her friends will gang up on you and slaughter you. Of course, she has a very interesting character, so all anime males should get to know her better.

So, if you see Kotomi anytime soon, say hi to her, and if she wants to play you a song because she likes you, make sure you get ready to run.

P.S. I like fish too.
