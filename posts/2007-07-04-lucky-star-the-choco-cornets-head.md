LOL. I wonder if it's actually possible that a girl would think about an insect and still happily much away at something that probably looks like a caterpillar. Ewww... If I were Tsukasa, I'll stop thinking about it right away. I guess Konata is okay with these sorts of things tho. I mean seriously if her stomach is that strong, I don't think you'll frighten her with a simply a rubber lizard or anything.
