The lack of Felli in the episodes following episode 4 is giving me withdrawal symptoms. I'm not sleeping very well right now so I'll make this short. Also, I think I've realized the reason I enjoyed Regios so much since I first started watching it. ITS THE LEGS.

I mean look at them, they definitely beat the genericness of most other anime. Most other anime simply don't make legs as scrumptious as the ones we see in Regios. These actually look like they could be eaten. Like, seriously I'm hungry already.

And look at Nina's zettais. Gosh those must be some of the best zettais I have ever seen ever since Shana showed hers in the first season. Let me remind you that these are no ordinary zettais. These are the zettais of a fit, brave and energetic young lady. What better material to show than the most prominent organs of a person.

I guess there is no surprise in the importance of the legs in determining how good a character looks. It is one of the most important things to us, for without it, most of us are pretty much crippled, even if we had wheelchairs. Hell, the importantance of legs is so much that the Chinese character for man (äºº) is made of the legs of the man. Its almost as if saying "a man is his legs". The word for independance in Malay (Berdikari) is actually derived from "Berdiri di kaki sendiri" which literally means, stand on your own feet. The same phrase brings the tone of independance in English as well.

What then, is a better measure of an anime girl, which has nothing but her looks, but the very legs that she possesses? Perhaps this is why skirts and swimsuits are so popular in anime. This is because skirts and swimsuits reveal the legs more than any clothing above the decency level. Girls tend to look smarter, and can have any attire, but the skirt will match anything they wear because a girl's legs will never offend.

Surely, peoples' taste for breast sizes may vary, but a girl's leg shape is never out of the question. After coming to this realization, I must say that I feel quite enlightened in a way, and happy that now I know what really makes or break's the drawing of a girl, and why I always seemed to be redoing the legs of a girl over and over again whenever I draw one. Perhaps... if I looked closer, I may notice something even more fundamental?
