I finally decided to open another 2 figmas, namely Kagamine Rin and Len. These two are the mascots of the new pair of voices released after Hatsune Miku for Vocaloid 2, and I must say Max Factory has done a good job in making these two figmas quite loveable indeed (even though one's a boy).

First of is Kagamine Rin. Max factory has nailed her looks down to the detail. It almost feels like the girl on the box jumped out at me and became a real life figma. Also, the joints were ingeniously well hidden in plain sight around the thighs. The arms still have quite a bit of protrusion going on and not much hiding like what Seto has, but she's definitely still attractive.

This photo is a little dark. Looks like I turned the flash a bit too low. Woops. Its kinda interesting to see her sleeves disappearing into the dark though. Imagine what it would look like when she's dancing!

Kagamine lying down on the touchpad and looking sexy. I would be lying if I said I didn't feel slightly aroused when I put her into this position. It almost feels like she's beckoning.

Unlike a lot of the previous figmas, this figma uses a lot more glossy paint than usual. My only complaint is that even the ribbon uses glossy paint, which I'm not sure is the right thing to do. Everything else looked awesome glossy though. Just the yellow tails below where the collars of the sailor uniform meet.

Its quite interesting to note also that the joints on the knees weren't as good as the Seto figma's joints too. I wonder if it has anything to do with production issues. You'd expect figmas to get better and better all the time right? Or maybe I got the timeline wrong. Maybe Seto was made AFTER Kagamine.

As I said earlir, the hip joints are incredibly well hidden, and they blend in with the shape of the figma splendidly. Also, observe the belt strap hanging off her belt. Only Max Factory would apply such detail to the figma, and make it look good even when viewed up close.

Kagamine's hair ribbons are also glossy. I wonder what's up with that? Those shouldn't be glossy. I can't imagine cloth reflecting light in such solid directions as a piece of metal. Perhaps this is a todo on the touchup list?

The makers of this figma have also thought through what she should look like from the back. Figmas always have a hole for an arm to hold up just in case you want them suspended or they cannot support themselves, but most of the time they have been quite visible. The twins however, now have higher holes, allowing the hole to be hidden behind the back uniform collar. Also, her hair is really nice from the back.

Rin wants a hugg. And I'd gladly give her one, if she weren't so tiny.

Moving on to Rin's brother and partner in crime, Len. He resembles Rin, as expected of siblings, but he also has an awesome guitar-style-handled keyboard! Quite the innovation. Like figma Nagato's guitar, Len's keyboard comes with a strap that helps hold his instrument close to his body, just like a real instrument. Unlike Nagato's one however, you have to hook the belt up yourself.

Rin's hair is kinda spiky, like Cloud Strife from FF7. But that doesn't make him look like the gloomy type. He smiles so wide, it seems like nothing can bring him down.

Len from the side. The knee joints aren't as spectacular here either.

Len from the top right.

The twins are J-J-JAMMING!

OH OH LOOK! ITS NAGATO! I didn't hear much of her guitar, but now come to think of it...

Oh Rin's finished singing, now its Nagato's turn to come out and blow the audience away with her pwning electric guitar riffs.
