If anyone of you has watched Toradora 5, you'd take this video to heart. This video, splendidly composed using Yui Horie's best performance yet, captures the true spirit of Minori and her off-tune singing, with some parrot and Taiga yawn thrown into the mix. This piece of gold is truly a reminder of how precious a treasure trove the Internet is. Enjoy.
