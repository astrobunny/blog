Alright! First music post. Its the guitar chords God Knows by Aya Hirano. The insert song in Suzumiya Haruhi no yuuutsu where Haruhi chips in (while still in her bunny suit) and replaces the lead singer of ENOZ in a performance during the Cultural Festival. Its my first annotation so it might be a little below standard. Feel free to tell me if there's anything wrong and comment! Thanks!
