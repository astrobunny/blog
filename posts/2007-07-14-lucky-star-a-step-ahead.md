I never played adult games so I wouldn't know. Well, I would if I had the bandwidth to download those. But no matter what, I think trying to get children to act like those game characters is already very much a psychological condition. Very much akin to wanting to shoot an AK-47 just because you miss CounterStrike. I'd hate it if I had such a teacher. All the girls in the class wouldn't be virgins anymore T\_T;
