Man I hate this map.  
  
Being far down in one corner close to the end of the world, it's hard to get anywhere (read Japan) easily and coupled with the enormous distances we have to travel to reach the shrines of anime and manga in Asia and America, you could say that we're pretty far away from the fun. Or are we? Luckily, a group of entrepreneurs over here decided to set up an entertainment expo down in Christchurch. The first year it came last year, like many first-time expos, there wasn't much to see (read Nothing) and we browsed through everything (read Failcakes) in the morning and still had time to celebrate a friend's birthday party which was awesome (starting with an O) in comparison. More photos after the jump.

BUT... This time its actually better than the last, for one thing, I found my "father".

And a wild Danny Choo appeared too!

Our voyeur cams picked up some Full Metal Alchemist cosplayers. The show had lots of stuff on sale, like DVDs and manga. Nothing to get excited about because we've seen it all and are fans of it or else we wouldn't even be coming to such an event. There were PS3s that could be played and a wrestling match (orz) outside of the conference hall. There was even a Mai Otome screening in the conference rooms when we were there. It was dubbed however, so we felt it was epic fail and left.

There was only one Haruhi. Can't complain... at least there was ONE Haruhi...

Doujin?  
  
I only took a limited amount of photos because I didn't have enough battery. But I didn't bother since I thought that I didn't need it anyway. Why did I go? Well I thought I could get something cheap from the show. I was so wrong. Nothing is cheap in New Zealand. I promise I'll have enough money to spend when I get to Comiket some day.

These Padme's are serious orz.  
  
The highlight of the expo for us however, is the cosplay contest. (Oh yeah). The cosplayers here actually managed to pull off something halfway decent. This is actually where I took most of the photos. The funniest part about walking into a conference hall expecting a cosplay contest is finding yourself seeing a bubble gum contents that hasn't finished yet. Of course, I found it hard to motivate myself to take any pictures of people blowing bubble gums. You can google it however.

Some kid actually donned a TMNT costume and became Michaelangelo for the day. That thing was so clumsy that it fell off the stage during the prizegiving.

Aria cosplayers. (Read: TRAPS) except one.  
  
 [![linkzelda.jpg](wp-uploads/2008/05/linkzelda.thumbnail.jpg)](/images/wp-uploads/2008/05/linkzelda.jpg "linkzelda.jpg")  
  
Link and Zelda (surprisingly, not traps!)

 [![deathnote.jpg](wp-uploads/2008/05/deathnote.thumbnail.jpg)](/images/wp-uploads/2008/05/deathnote.jpg "deathnote.jpg")  
  
Death Note crew. These guys won the best character award. Quote the announcer "they were in character the moment they walked into the room" I must note one of them is a trap. Go ahead, guess who.  
  
 [![bleach.jpg](wp-uploads/2008/05/bleach.thumbnail.jpg)](/images/wp-uploads/2008/05/bleach.jpg "bleach.jpg")  
  
The bleach crew pulled off a "What captains do when no one is around". I ROFLed when I saw Kuchiki Byakuya digging his nose. [

Forgive the bad pictures. No DM and DC-style press passes you see... I'm working on it.  
  
 [![who.jpg](wp-uploads/2008/05/who.thumbnail.jpg)](/images/wp-uploads/2008/05/who.jpg "who.jpg")  
  
I'm not sure who this fella is. I don't follow Naruto much anymore  
  
 [![narutards.jpg](wp-uploads/2008/05/narutards.thumbnail.jpg)](/images/wp-uploads/2008/05/narutards.jpg "narutards.jpg")  
  
More Akatsuki. There seems to be a large population of Narutards and Bleachtards around.
