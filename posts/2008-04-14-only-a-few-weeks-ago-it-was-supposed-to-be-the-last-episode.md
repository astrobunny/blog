After missing the last 5 minutes of the last episode as a result of a big big \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*, I was shocked to see this. I can't believe I missed the most important part!!! Argh! As if not having enough time to troll around and look out for the spring season's new anime is enough, I have to suffer the torment of missing something in the middle! This is unacceptable! - is what I thought until I was overcome by Nagisa's extreme dereness that gave me a moe explosion. I'm not one to simply go boom from dereness but Nagisa has always been very popular with me. [

Also from this episode, I never knew how strong Mei was. I must admit, if the bread tasted like shattered glass, I would never have the strength to go further and flatter the maker on how good it is with a straight face. This must be one of those qualities you lose when you grow up. I also never knew how good she was at doing business. By exploiting the fact that Nagisa is cute... she took this:

... and turned it to this...

... and made this...

A true creator indeed. In other news, I have also learned from this anime that when your imagination runs wild, try and hit the brakes hard, because the next two pictures should be taken with a bit of salt. I mean, I never knew Okazaki had such a vivid imagination... It actually felt like it was right... but I really find that disgusting. Like, worse than Akiko jam and Akio bread.

The picture above was the gheyest scene ever. Like, literally. I didn't want to take the picture after this one because it was disgusting beyond words. I mean, I cannot imagine anyone wearing boxers with a big heart on them. And I don't even want to imagine two shops selling a pair of them. \*goes off to puke. Ugh... Kyoani, what have you done? Those were the most rotten scenes ever! \>\_\<" It must be punishment for not following the series faithfully enough. Though, this episode has one saving grace:

I'm sure they'll make a lovely couple.
