Well, it's that time of year again. Most people have a love/hate relationship with this day, for many and varied reasons. Some hate spending today alone, others wish it could last forever because they are finally left alone. Humans are truly intriguing. Although social beings we may be, sometimes culture and seasons demand change, and sometimes it's Christmas that demands the most change.  
  
It seems almost supernatural to think that during this day, 90% of the people in the world stops in their lives completely and celebrates/does something different. While there must be some essence and reason into why this day is so special, the fact of the matter is that it is one (if not the only) of the very few special days that the entire civilized world observes at the same time.  
  
For those of you who are spending Christmas alone, don't worry you're not alone. Hundreds, nay thousands of people are still sitting in mIRC chatting about random stuff. If you feel like it, pop over. As for me, I'm off to a little party. So see you all and have a Merry Christmas!
