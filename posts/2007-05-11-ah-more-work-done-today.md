I just got my car washed! Now I can start doing some uploading and some of my work again! woot...  
  
Also, it looks like there has already been 3 books of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu mangas. I'm late for the party. However, due to my pragmatic nature with finance, I decided to preview the manga before I went off to amazon.co.jp and clicked on BUY NOW. So, here are my findings...  
  
<!--more-->  
  
First thing I noticed, was the cover of the comic book was impressive enough, with the same style of art I found on the novels themselves. At the back it read Haruhi's most famous quotes "I have no interest in ordinary humans. If there are aliens, time-travellers, and espers among you, then come to me. That is all." Well, alright. I'm an alien kthx.

So I ran in and read the comic (The scans here are scanlations I ripped from [K-H] ^^; kudos to them for scanlating the manga! Whether I read them or not is another question. But anyway, the first thing I noticed was, Kyon. Yes. Kyon. The apathetic highschool classmate of Suzumiya Haruhi and nicknamed narrator and story-teller of the Haruhi series. Why notice this sarcastic and cynical guy first of all, when Haruhi-sama is all the more superior to the only normal human in the SOS brigade? Well, lemme tell you why. Just look at the scan below. Click to see it. Don't worry. You don't need your back button.

The artist obviously is different from the ones(pwners) at KyoAni. Something makes me think that Kyon just doesn't look right at all! He looks like a kid! He is supposed to be the sole voice of reason in the brigade and seriously, he's gotta look more mature than that or else the voice would definitely not fit in! But I guess its the truth... They messed up the manga. I'd rather continue reading the bland novels while imagining KyoAni's power strokes of colour that makes up the world of Haruhi I prefer. Next, take a look at this picture.

Does it remind you of something? Yes. Of course it doesn't. Haruhi simply dragged Kyon out halfway in the middle of homeroom shouting in the hall saying "How stupid of me not to notice something as simple as this". Since when did Haruhi just drag Kyon out and telling him that all the clubs are boring??! When did Haruhi call herself stupid!? It's the OTHER WAY AROUND!! They aren't following the novels! OMG! THEY RUINED IT. First Kyon now the story!? I wonder what's next?? A fatass Yuki?

Looks like I was half right. For those of you who have watched Suzumiya Hahiru (no, this is not a typo. Go google it), you would know what I mean. Yuki Nagato... The most popular loli of all time, and the ruler of the great database and pwner in the Day of Sagittaurus, looks damn unhot and unloli IMO. Why... why... did they have to defile the great Goddess of Knowledge and Programming!? why? T\_T  
  
\*goes to sit in a corner to cry  
  
Overall, the drawings are slightly less than satisfactory (T\_T) and the authors of the manga decided not to faithfully follow the sequence of actions as in the novels. Other than that, the attractive cover makes for a good first impression of the comic. I still want to buy it but...  
  
Screw it. My 1500 Yen is better off spent elsewhere.
