Today, we shall find out if the myth that says "you are what you eat" is indeed true. Specifically, today we will determine whether or not eating awesome makes you awesome. Our mythbuster today is Kataoka Yuuki, and she will attempt to eat Tacos, and be able to utilize Taco power in her native east wind.

Yuuki prepared a Taco for this purpose, and will eat it just before the mahjong game in order to be able to harness its full power.

The reason for this is, from past statistical experiments, we have estimated the time for tacos (if effective) to be effective in providing the consumer with the ability to predict and infer tile successions and possible combinations of the opponents to be within 10% of the initial inference accuracy level for about 20 minutes immediately after consumption. Since each hanchan takes about 15 minutes to complete, a Taco will only last Yuuki for one hanchan.

Due to an unforseen factor however, we were unable to perform the experiment in the first round due to the Tacos prepared for the experiment being consumed by accident by another opponent.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-15-500x283.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-15.jpg)  
  
Of course, this was just a minor setback.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-22-500x283.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-22.jpg)  
  
Another opponent was kind enough to provide a similar substitute.  
  

## Round 1
  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-23-500x283.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-23.jpg)  
  
However, due to our lack of data on Takos at the time of the experiment, we were unable to gauge the effectiveness of the Takos which were consumed in place of the lost Tacos. We were also unable to make certain that Takos do not have carry over effects. This however, remains to be studied.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-24-500x283.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-24.jpg)  
  
Yuuki however, was quite certain that Takos had a similar effect to Tacos due to similarities in nomenclature. We decided that because there were 2 hanchans in this round, we will be able to find another Taco in time to perform the failed experiment on the second hanchan.

We will be sure to take into account the observations made in this round in subsequent experiments with Takos.

Due to the unpredictable nature of the experiment, we were unable to qualify our observations properly.  
  

## Round 2
  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-30-500x283.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-30.jpg)  
  
Just before the 2nd round, we were able to secure another unit of Awesome Tacos for the experiment.   
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-31-500x283.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-31.jpg)  
  
Due to the immediacy of the subsequent hanchan, we were able to get Yuuki to consume the Tacos immediately.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-32-500x283.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-32.jpg)  
  
Yuuki reports that in the next hanchan we would be able to perform the experiment normally.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-34-500x283.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-34.jpg)  
  
In our next round we were able to observe the expected range of inferential accuracies that our past studies have predicted.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-35-500x283.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-35.jpg)  
  
As a result Yuuki was able to perform a large chin itsu with a dora tile. However, localised winning is not important in this experiment, since we are testing for overall performance that the Tacos will hypothetically be able to provide.

Aside from a few setbacks in the beginning of the round which was caused by probablilistic error, Yuuki seemed to be able to perform as normal and sometimes even above average during the middle of the game.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-37-500x283.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-37.jpg)  
  
Her above average performance is noted.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-41-500x283.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-41.jpg)  
  
Our observations were in favour of the myth.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-42-500x283.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-42.jpg)  
  
It turned out however, that this was only a localised effect of deliberate assistance.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-46-500x283.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-46.jpg)  
  
We soon realized that the Tacos did not have the desired cumulative effect on the performance of Yuuki.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-47-500x283.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/06/wpid-shinji-saki-09-e08479d9-47.jpg)  
  
Despite our observations, we continue to uphold the stance that Tacos are indeed awesome, but from our observations in this round of the mahjong tournament, we have come to the conclusion that eating awesome Tacos does not automatically make you awesome. And by induction, you do not inherit the awesomeness of the food you eat. In other words, you are not what you eat.

Thus we have come to the conclusion that this myth is baseless, and is hereby declared BUSTED. See you next time.
