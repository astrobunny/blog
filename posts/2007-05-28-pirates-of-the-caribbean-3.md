Alright! Time for a post again. Today I just came back from university after 4 hours of pure struggling with my Software Project, which was a real pain. Well, actually I aimed extremely high. Our goal was to create a game. I wanted to make a strategy game and I guess that took its toll. Anyway, time for a late promise fulfilled.  
  
 ![Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End](http://gallery.astrobunny.net/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=272&g2_serialNumber=1)<!--more-->  
  
Last Friday me and members of the Legion of Mary went to the cinema to watch At World's End. I gotta say I'm impressed by how Disney still manages to make such entertaining things. Do they have entertainment generators there that churn out vids and ideas every half hour?? I wonder. They seem to be pulling all sorts of strange things out of their arses everyday!

Well, I guess this picture says it all. A lot of people came down to see how Chow Yun Fatt was gonna be making Pirates more entertaining. I even suspect some people came to watch just because he is acting! Needless to say, he was pretty out of place. And Singapore... LOL. SINGAPORE heh... Well, its true that there were many many pirates around the Port of Singapore back in the days of the East India Company, but LOL. And they speak Cantonese! DBLLOL I always thought the people in Singapore spoke Hokkien. I guess times do change. I think that his acting didn't really convince me a lot in the scenes he was in. I felt that he was rather pretensive on his accent, and I just couldn't quite stand it. He should talk like Limpeh. That would actually sound much more realistic, better and funnier.

"I love you"

  

Putting that aside however, Jack and Co are still the same old funny bunch, pulling stupid jokes and acting stupid and doing ridiculous things. Never ceases to keep my stomach busy staying hard. Well, actually, unlike the past 2 Pirates movies, this one didn't make me laugh the whole way. (I'm talking as if this was supposed to be a comedy. But from the looks of it, it seems that was the very intention of the movie.) I think they overdid the jokes and they just became a bit too over the edge to be funny. In other words, they were acting so stupid it wasn't funny. There was this part where a poor Asian sailor had frostbite and lost his toe while trying to bend it. Yes it broke off. I don't find that funny at all. You probably got to have a really sick sense of humour to do so.

  
 ![Jack chases his ship.](http://gallery.astrobunny.net/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=268&g2_serialNumber=1)  
  
Well, basically the story kicks off from last time when Barbossa (reincarnate) appears for the second time to lead the kids to save Captain Jack. He leads them to some unknown place, although it actually seemed like he wanted them to get lost. Well, he said that some places can only be found when you are lost, or else everyone would know where it is... @\_@ makes sense, but heh... Then we see Jack in the desert playing with rocks and seeing his ship sail on land. Well, I guess that's enough spoilers for now but you get my drift.  
  
 ![Pirate Council](http://gallery.astrobunny.net/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=270&g2_serialNumber=1)  
  
So basically, they are bringing Jack back because Barbossa wants to unite the 9 pirate lords who supposedly control the piracy around the world, since the East India Company has the services of the Flying Dutchman now and are fighting piracy like the RIAA. They wanna 133ch out the awesome Calipso who could supposedly stop the Flying Dutchman and the rampage of the East India Company.   
  
 ![Shipwreck Cove](http://gallery.astrobunny.net/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=274&g2_serialNumber=1)  
  
The story continues with lots of awesome CGs of various parts of the Eastern Theatre and blasphemously crazy royal rumbles on ships in whirlpools. Overall, still a great movie, and worth watching for the sake of completion. Also, some special people make guest appearances during the show, and really makes me wonder how big they actually made the POTC world. Oh well. I am supposed to be watching Shana right now so I'll just sign off here and recommend the movie to everyone :)
