I know very well how they feel. After living for years on end in a cold country like New Zealand, spending time near the equator where the temperature is a constant 30C is capable of driving people to extreme measures to cool themselves down.

I tried swimming wear too. But I didn't wear a girl's swimsuit. Only Kagami did. But it only made me want to jump into the pool.

I tried putting my head against the aquarium. It was fairly cool but not as cool as you'd like it to be. Thankfully my aquarium didn't have a thermostat, so it was always quite cool.

Lying on the table didn't work however, it heated up to my temperature fairly quickly.

So I decided to be "one with the heat". Like the saying goes: if you can't beat them, join them. Didn't end too well though. I ended up soaking my clothes with sweat.

Next I tried ghost stories, since it sends "shivers up your spine". It didn't help though because while I felt shivers, I felt nowhere as cold, and my brother barging into the house didn't help either. That made me jump and I felt hot again.

So I surrounded myself with big posters of Antarctica and imagined that I was sitting in the snow just like in New Zealand, but the posters stopped the air from flowing and the room just heated up from the sunshine.

So sitting in front of the fan and humming into the blades kept me occupied for a while.

I found some ice in the fridge and ate it to keep cool then. But after that my mouth just went all cold, and I felt hot again. Of course, I didn't fill a pail up with ice because I didn't have that much around.

After watching the entire episode, I realized I forgot I had an air conditioner in my room. That's what happens when you leave home for too long. You forget about even your own room.
