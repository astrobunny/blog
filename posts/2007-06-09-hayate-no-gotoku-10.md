This episode can be summarized in one word: Random. Are the guys at Shogakukan and TV Tokyo trying to imitate Shaft!? I mean, references to other anime once in a while is okay, but omg. Alright. Its fine by me but Hayate no Gotoku doesn't seem like the kind of anime which does so many references to other shows. Interestingly however, I found it strangely funny at the time I watched it. At times lame, and at sometimes confusing. Oh well. Today is Tabletier's birthday party so I'm gonna have to write this review tomorrow. Check back again for some of the interesting highlights of the references made in Hayate no Gotoku EP 10! Meanwhile, feast your eyes on our beloved Student Council President Hinagiku!
