Its summer 2009, and I've never said this before, but there's too much anime to watch. There are more than 20 weekly shows lined up and another 10 sets of OVAs and OADs to watch out for. That's 1 1/2 hours a day, 10.5 hours a week, 45 hours a month. Not much. But the time spend downloading performing black magic on the shows is enough to drive me mad. Don't know about you though.
