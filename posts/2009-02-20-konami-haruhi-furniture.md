Not too many posts ago I said that I got a Konami Haruhi figure. That's right. Konami. Thus breaking my tradition of only getting stuff from Max Factory. However, the selling point of this figure was actually the furniture that came with it. If it was just the figure I probably wouldn't have even bothered. They actually used a drawing on the front of the box. Doesn't say much about their confidence in the product.

Here we go. This is the left side of the box. As you can see its pretty simplistic. Nothing much to talk about compared to the Max Factory ones other than the fact that its got the "Made in China" feel to it.

Here's the back of the package. Not very enthusiastically arranged, but decent enough to say its still pretty attractive. It shows the computer and furniture set as well as how haruhi is meant to stand on the chair. You'll see why in a moment.

Here's the side of the box. Its got a small window from which you can use to peek sideways at Haruhi to examine her endowedness if you so desire. At least there's a big picture here of the figure itself.

Here's the box from the top. Another window to look down in from to ensure that the contents are genuine. Let me assure you this is the genuine Haruhi from Konami and not some fake cheap chinese imitation, though it does resemble one, it still has the feel of quality to it that Japanese figure makers are known for. I've omitted the bottom of the box because it is just plain white, so there really isn't anything special there.

The box is sealed in a very standard way. Reminescent of general electrical appliances sold at Briscoes. Unlike the figmas which have a breakable seal, instead the two sides of the box are simply cellotaped down. Cutting them doesn't exactly the celebratory feel of opening the package.

Before I go into the actual contents of the box, I'll just show you the contents list so all of you know exactly what you really are getting. Here's what it says:  
  
  
  
Figure Body - 1  
  
CPU - 1  
  
Monitor - 1  
  
Keyboard - 1  
  
Pyramid - 1  
  
Desk - 1  
  
Chair - 1  
  
Platform - 1  
  
Cords - 4  
  
Mouse - 1  
  
  
  
... Thats right. Mouse. I think the mouse size suits my figmas more than the figure. Actually I'll say that for the whole furniture set.

First of all, a picture of what the plastic framing looks like out of the box. It is quite neatly packaged. Enough to make you feel excitied about actually getting the figure. You can see all the materials I described just now. The cords are just below the CPU and there's a platform to which the chair can attach to. That's the yellow stuff right at the bottom.  
  
  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4025-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4025.jpg)  
  
  
  
This framing has got a lot of parts. The platform is on the bottommost part, and is the one I took out first. It's held together with the other pieces with more cellotape. An exceedingly cheap way of securing parts, but effective nevertheless.

In order to retrieve the other parts, you need to remove the 2 layers of plastic framing that protect the figure and the furniture. Yes. 2 layers. Its overly well-protected for a figure of this stature. But that's not a bad thing.

Here's Haruhi being removed from the packaging. One of the good things about figures that aren't really packaged in a premium box is that you don't feel hurt whenever you open the box. Its probably good since I didn't buy this for the figure. Haruhi looks pretty decent. The paintjob is superb and the folds and waves in the clothing is captured nicely.

Actually there wasn't anything really wrong with this figure. It just looked like it was designed by amateurs. Its painted quite professionally. If you are curious, her panties aren't white. They are actually a very pale shade of orange, which I believe is more normal than pure white. below her skirt isn't painted very well and was probably an afterthought. Then again, figures were not made to be violated were they?

Another view of her from the front.

Next is furniture! Here you'll notice that I didn't include the mouse in the photograph. That was because it was wrapped in so much plastic it seemed like a piece of rubbish I was about to throw it away. The hole you see on the table is actually where the monitor will fit on to. I thought it was pretty lame that only the monitor could stick on the table but oh well. You can also see little notches on the floor. That's for attaching the chair. The table simply rests on the platform, which seems a little halfhearted to me.

The mandatory "Brigade Leader" pyramid.

Here's the CPU with the cords. To be honest, the cords weren't exactly friendly to work with since they kept coming out. When I tried to glue them in with all the parts, the parts were so light that they actually pulled each other around when I tried to move stuff. Annoying.  
  
  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4047-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4047.jpg)  
  
  
  
The mouse. I told you the packaging made it look like trash.  
  
  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4048-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4048.jpg)  
  
  
  
The mouse is pretty damn small. Here's a picture comparing it to the figure's hand. OBVIOUSLY not for the figure. The mouse should be about the size of your hand and not your palm. The figma's hands were actually much better scaled for it. Which begs the question: did Konami actually make the furniture so figma fans would buy it? Its actually a viable business decision.

Ok so the process of putting all the furniture together was pretty boring so I'll skip that part. Here's the completed set with figmas on it instead. Look at how well scaled it is. I get the feeling that Konami really wanted us figma collectors to buy this figure just for the furniture. Indeed, I fell into the trap. Call me crazy.  
  
  
  
On another note however, it was extremely difficult to fit the wire into the mouse. I had to use a knife and skin the wire a bit so it would be narrow enough to enter the hole. Talk about circumsicion.

Haruhi is excited to learn C from Nagato, who is actually surprisingly good at explaining the arcane concepts of pointers and memory. I wonder what Mikuru is up to...
