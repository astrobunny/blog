Well, looks like judgement day is going to be coming sooner than expected. The second coming of the incredibly highly anticipated [Suzumiya Haruhi](http://www.haruhi.tv/)anime series has been made public on NewType Magazine. OMG! When I saw darkmirage and some other bloggers blog about it, I jumped. An immediate rush was made to the Japanese BBSes and sure enough, I found "ハルヒ2期今度こそ本当に決定!" (Haruhi second season is really official this time!) [KyoAni](http://www.kyotoanimation.co.jp/ "KyoAni")has not made any official announcement yet. I'd expect it to come soon though. since they need to update the TV Guides. The show is expected to air autumn this year.
