It's November 11th again, and its Azunyan's birthday. I have never really posted to her birthday lately but this time it's different. She is 18 years old this year, and officially a legal adult now. Don't get me wrong, she is like a sister to me. (okay not quite) But her twintails are top class.

As a reward for those of you who do read past the jump, here are some really nice pics (vastly superior to mine) that I stole off Pixiv in commemoration of her birthday.
