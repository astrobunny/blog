Looks like another crazy anime has just come out. Kyouran Kazoku Nikki means the Diaries of the Mad Family, and the show has really lived up to its name since the first episode. It all starts off with this catgirl running around town in an Oliver Twist-esqe rampage of food collection, but starts to get random once this girl reveals who she really is. She meets Ouka Midarezaki (which contains the character ä¹±, which means mayhem or chaos) who appears to be a member of some random shadowy organization involved with finding stuff like UFOs or supernatural stuffs (Haruhi's dream). It turns out that a family has been organized to track down the child of a once great monster to kill it, and Ouka is bound to be the man of the house. \*\* there may be spoilers in this post \*\*

So the first thing to do when you want to start a family is to get married. However, this was the last thing Ouka wanted to do, but with a massive tsundere/control freak that Kyouka (the cat girl) is, like any other ordinary human being, he does not really have a choice, and was ceremoniously wed in the lobby of the building of the organization that he works for.

Having become married, they get a house and Kyouka gets all hyped up about the life of a normal human being and tries to show that after much study, she is also well-versed in the "Arts" as well. The producers did this one well, since something so flat usually gets so much attention, its a status symbol. Now I believe she's a princess

So they set out looking for their children, which is also just a random mass of pure silliness and no substance whatsoever. Ouka sets out to find the children by noticing the red armbands that those marked for entering the family wear, and Kyouka, well has the services of advanced tracking systems and spatial location satellites. Then they go messing around in town while looking for parts of their family which includes a Yakuza girl, a Lion, a killer robot, a gender-confused person and a jellyfish.

Yes. That person doesn't quite realize he is a boy.

After the amazing family-making trip, the family then returns to their new home as a new and exciting adventure is on its horizon. Well, I really don't know what to say about the ending because practically the entire episode has left me sitting on the chair speechless. I have no idea how the producers came up with something like this. Oh well, at least now there's something light to watch again.
