I've been playing a lot of FlyFF lately. Its just a cute game with cartoony characters and everything is really easy to do. Yes, that's my character. If you ever spot her on the Clockworks server make sure you say hi. I'm very generous with giving away weapons and armor that I pick up.

The thing I love about this game is that you can fly. This means you can go to those islands in the air up there in the background. The game is 3D, so you get to see cities from up high and noobs levelling on cute little mushrooms. There's also aerial combat.

And there are a lot of paper airships hanging on top of cities that don't do anything but look pretty.
