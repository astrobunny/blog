Not too long ago I suddenly acquired a nendoroid Louise. Why Louise? Well, no particular reason really. It turned out that she looked a bit cuter than everyone else, including Miku that prompted me to get her. Besides, we needed to balance the incredible amount of [yellow](http://www.astrobunny.net/2008/12/23/kagamine-rin/) already on my desk.

The default face of Louise is more than faithful to the extreme case of tsundere that is Louise. You can imagine her saying all sort of things ranging from BAKA INU to YURUSANAI DAKARA.

But! She also comes with a very very very loveable and kyuuuuuute oh I'm so sad face. God, she looks like candy when she puts this face on. \*reminds self its plastic....\* its plastic... its plastic... its plastic...

And to aggravate it all, she even comes with the ONII CHAN NO IJIWARU face. (ijiwaru=bully) And even has little teardrops in her eyes. \*its plastic... its plastic... its plastic...  
  
OM NOM NOM NOM

Besides the cape, Louise comes with a bunch of extra arms for various types of poses, and 3 wands. One practice rigid wand, one bendy wand and one wan that is rigid but bent! I wonder what the sculptors at good smile company were thinking when they included the rigid bent wand... Perhaps they wanted to see photos of Nendo SM?

GRR Louise is angry. Don't make her even more made than she already is or she'll really hurt you.
