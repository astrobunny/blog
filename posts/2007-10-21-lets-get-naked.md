This is probably one of the extremely few times I'll post any screencaps coming out of fansubs. But was just so hilarious the first time I saw it. I mean, yeah the girls are hot and stuff but man, this cartoon looks like it was made in the 90's. I enjoyed it tho, and especially the green-haired girl who likes to swim naked apparently is the cause of this song being chosen for the OP. I wouldn't call swimming close to the surface of the water "flying high" but if it's a bunch of highschool girls swimming in modern "non PE" swimsuits, I'm sure there will be a tissue loaded audience ready to pounce on every episode that comes out. Don't get me wrong. I watch this because its FUNNY.
