Today I took a bus downtown and sat at Starbucks to write up a report. Since this involves the Federation Starfleet and defense technology, I can't really say much about it, but I took Kagamin with me to keep me company.

An interesting thing about Starbucks is that because they serve coffee, you'll never fall asleep doing your paperwork here. Also, I found myself being strangely productive compared to writing in my room. 10 pages in 3 hours!

Its probably because of all the figmas running around doing weird things I get distracted so much I end up playing with them. I guess I've gotta go somewhere else just to do my work because my room simply doesn't have the kind of conducive environment for doing work.

Another great thing about getting out of your room and sitting in a public place to do your work is that because people are looking at you, there's the pressure to look busy and BE busy. And since everyone with a laptop near you is doing something productive, doing your work helps you fit in.

Though, you should always space out each hour of work with short breaks with anime or bring a manga to read. It helps keep you zoned. Don't watch anime with cliffhangers or anything exciting though, it will ruin your concentration. ARIA works very well for me.

At about 6 o'clock, it was time to pack up and head home for dinner. Kagami looked pretty tired because she had to watch me type out technical jargon and slap me when I miss my grammar once in a while because I'm listening to anime music at the same time. I too needed some catch some early rest because tonight we were going to go stargazing. I hope the skies will stay clear tonight...
