I think that despite this episode being the last episode of a long line of the same episode, the reason for calling this episode a breath of fresh air is not that it is the end of a crucifying series of constant reanimation of the same thing, but rather the fact that KyoAni has put some effort into making Haruhi's tantrum scene an amazing one. For some reason, this angry girl looks very cute to me. This is a picture post of just Haruhi.

She even has a bit of Azusa in her too. I wonder if they are related...
