Not to mention it needs moar Felli. WTF is this, I turn on the TV and all of a sudden its the biggest fight in the world, when only last episode everyone was wondering what was going on and they fired the Kayrawr-Kannon once and pseudo-killed the monster, only to get 2 more. And what was with the dog faces anyway? Seriously is Regios going to end just like this after all that hype in NewType?

And all of a sudden the monster becomes uber-powerful and uber-fast and goes and starts attacking Zuellini. WTF? If it could why didn't it do it earlier? Oh right, its the LAST EP. The director must've like shouted at the monster and bitched about how they won't have another episode and it would have to finish off Zuellini NOW. So the monster just went Bankai and screwed a few whirlpools in the lakes of the city.

And when I saw Nina's haikizoku taken from her, I was like, whoa that was quick. How come no one thought of that? Just punch her stomach and you'll get the goatse.cx! Also, all of a sudden the guy with the white hair who's the heaven's blade suddenly gets the haikizoku and becomes the most powerful man on Regios. Then suddenly some explosion happened and he was gone. WTF happened? Don't tell me getting the haikizoku's uber +9999 Attack lowers your HP to 1.

All of a sudden, Fon-fon's Heaven's blade and Leerin's Katana gattais and turns fonfon into the most powerful loser on Regios, and he cuts open the uberpowerful monster with uberpowerful yellow energy that magically also makes it vulnerable to the big blue cannon. Then, all of a sudden all 11 Heavens Blades of Grendand come and destroy the monster that they were not able to beat in the previous round. And the Engrish spkr Saya suddenly appears to favour fonfon.

Seriously, this story has no continuity at all. Worse, its (omg) obviously a rushed ending. And WORST of ALL, フェリが足りないぃぃぃぃ！！！　(Not enough Felli). God, to think I was sucked into believing this would actually be a decent series. (屮゜Д゜)屮

Well, at least we got to see Felli's awesome shin kick one last time.
