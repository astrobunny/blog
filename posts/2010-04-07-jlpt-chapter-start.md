In an attempt to measure my weaboo power level, I decided to take The Test. After an hour and a half of wrestling with Kagami over what I should be writing in the form, we finally came to the conclusion that Kagami was right and I shouldn't write "To aru hoshizora no Astrobunny" as my real name. Of course, I knew that. I just wanted to have a certificate with an awesome index-esqe name. Anyway, Kagami has forced a strict schedule for my studies on me so it seems I won't be very free any time soon.
