On a little corner of this sports field opposite the road from the university is a little enclave full of colourful delights. Because more flowers are blooming now, Kagami and I decided to go have a look at their progress.

Unlike the other flower gardens, this one was pure nature. There were no signboards to tell us what the flowers' names were. So all we could do was look and make up names for them in order to be able to refer to them. Since these were purple, we decided to call this flower Fujisaki.

Kagami noticed that these flowers looked a lot like the capillary pattern caused by a certain disease manufactured artificially by a pharmaceutical company. So we decided to call it Ua.

This flower was so awesomely pretty. After much debate, I decided to call this flower Hinagiku.

As we moved deeper into the enclave, the flowers just got denser and denser. It became so colourful it felt like my camera was growing eyelashes.

We saw a really pretty bush. Kagami was interested to know how the plant photosynthesized with almost its entire surface area being non-green. I guess that's what gardeners are for. To serve the luxurious needs of these flowers.

A little further down the path, we saw these hueg ass flowers that we didn't know the names of. They were really pretty though, and looked like huge pieces of tissue hanging out of a big Kleenex Tree.

The flower was so magnormous, we decided to call it Nodoka.

There were so many flowers, but there was even more! We wondered how much more this road extended. We found it hard to believe that such a huge flower garden was hidden behind the trees in the corner of a housing estate that is nothing more than a featureless neighbourhood when viewed from the outside.

We also found these cool looking blue flowers. They had thin petals, and were slightly translucent and slightly reflective. It was a challenge to get the right settings to take photos of these. But I am inspired by Maria Oosawa amd the legendary Tomitake Flash.

Oh yeah, about the name, we decided to call these Natsuru.

After a bit more walking, we found another Nodoka Tree. This one looked a lot healthier than the last one, and they looked like they are whiter too, maybe a different species. _Nodokaus Shiroius_

We then came across a corner and found some really really lovely mixes of Nodokas and Red Uas.

More pretty Uas.

As we walked, we noticed that part of the garden was along a river. The water made for a damned nice scenery. Kagami was sad she didn't bring her swimsuit. But there's no way I'm letting her swim in that drink.

We kept going, and there was just more and more flowers. It was like exploring an infinitely large gem field in Command and Conquer and slowly unfolding the fog of war.

There was a little field along the river, and another area with yet more flowers. How big is this place anyway? Did I end up in wonderland?

The fallen sakuras made the entire ground feel like it was covered with snow.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0400-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0400.JPG)  
  
It was like, snowy with sakura petals everywhere. Since this area is surrounded by trees, there isn't much wind, so the petals don't get blown away. So you end up with a pink carpet.

Awesome fork. Time to choose the road less travelled.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0427-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0427.JPG)  
  
Kagami spotted little Belldandies

We found some pale yellow Uas. They looked really interesting.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0433-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0433.JPG)  
  
We kept looking at them but we knew we couldn't pick them. So Kagami decided to relax and stare at it for a while.

We were finally at the end of the road. It was such a large flower garden, where a bunch of houses and bush were supposed to be, there were only flowers. Kagami was enthralled by the abundance of color in this garden. We might come again in the near future for fun.

Here's another view of the little stream that runs through the flower garden.

After a while, we finally came to the end of the flower garden. It was such a wonderful sight, like Su decided to go nuts and plant an entire Royal Garden of flowers and magically squeeze it into what would otherwise just be a boring secondary forest.
