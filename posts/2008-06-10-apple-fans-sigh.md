I always wondered about Mac fanaticism, but when I saw what Danny Choo had to say about Macs and how Apple fans continued to argue about how one mouse button is better than two, I suddenly realized that not only were mac fans loyal customers, they subscribed to Stevism. Every word that comes out of his mouth during a keynote is welcomed with worship and praise fit for the saviour and the messiah. Tis' the season of the WWDC and I'm sure all of you have heard the great apple speak and his loyal minions crying with tongues of brushed metal and glass LONG LIVE STEVE JOBS... rofl.
