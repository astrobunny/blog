It appears ASCII Media Works and Nintendo DS are coming up with something that will be recieved very well in the anime fan world in the next few days. A game called [Dengeki Gakuen: Cross of Venus](http://d-game.dengeki.com/gakuen/index.html) is an action/RPG game for the DS that will feature all the stars from light novels published by under the Dengeki Bunko label. So what's so special about them? Well, for those of you who don't know, the light novels include some famous names like: Shakugan no Shana, To Aru Majutsu no Index, Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu and Toradora. Feeling the excitement now?  
  
The game's going to be released on March 19th, which is like, just days away. Who's getting it? (Gameplay pics after the jump)

This looks like its going to be an extremely fun game to say the least. Being able to play some of the most famous characters in the anime world in one single game would be any moe lover's wet dream. Our prayers have been answered. Oh and for those of you who were wondering, the girl in brown hair (not Taiga) is called Kasugai Kizuna. I like that name.

Kagami would probably be delighted to play it when it comes out.
