Square Enix and Aniplex have recently released Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood on TV and to be honest I really wondered what they would show, since the previous Fullmetal Alchemist series was already so kickass and went through the whole story already. It turns out however, that this is more of a rewrite. Frankly, I felt bored halfway through the first episode this show and suddenly wished it would end sooner, because I was getting irritated at how helpless Edward and Alphonse were against the Ice Alchemist. WHERE DID THE KICKASS ELRIC GO? His pwning streak probably left him along with the art goodness.  
  
But! Instead of brooding over what the current series is, lets take a look at the biggest observable difference this show has from its predecessor: The Art. Its worth noting that Bones, the group that animated the previous series, is also animating this one. They were probably trying to make it look more like the art from the manga.

Here's a comparison between Edward from now and then. Besides the aspect ratio difference, you can see that the previous series had their heads longer, with rounder eyes. Not to mention a smaller ahoge for Edward, that probably fits in with the dark mood that the previous series had.

It is interesting to note however, that Roy Mustang doesn't look all that different from the previous series than the one now. Apart from the longer face, which I'm sure almost no one would notice unless the two pictures were placed side by side, his narrow eyes and spiky hair still dominate the major features of his face.

Here's Major Armstrong. Oh my god. Eyelashes. That SO did not appear in the previous series. By far the most humourous character in FMA. Its amazing that the consistency at which he flashes his body at other men does not prompt any of the characters to call him "gay".

Here's Major Hughes from now and then. This one also doesn't have very striking differences from the previous series, but the way he was depicted in the previous series gave him more the impression of a playboy than a family guy which he is.

Or maybe the most striking resemblance is Rei Ayanami and Hughes's wife. Is it just me, or does she really resemble Rei?
