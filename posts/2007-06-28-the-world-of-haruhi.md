A Haruhiist has made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land of Nishinomiya Town. This town is located somewhere in Kansai near Hyougo. It is the place where Haruhi Suzumiya (a.k.a. "God") lives/lived in the animated series, and this devout pilgrim has had the honor and privilege to make it to this most sacred town to worship and admire the consecrated grounds itself! Pray to Haruhi that I may someday have the opportunity too to follow the stars of Orihime and Hikoboshi to pay tribute myself to Her.  
  
Okay enough religious talk for now. [This site](http://www.rinku.zaq.ne.jp/p_v/haruhi.html) is a site created by a fellow who made the trip around Nishinomiya and took photos of the places used in the scenes of the animated series, and placed the photos side by side with the scenes used. The artists who drew the animated series Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu apparently chose somewhere close to home to set the scenes for the unfolding of the story. (if you didn't know, they are from Kyoto Animation) They took photos of many many places and placed the characters nicely into the scenes to tell the story almost exactly the way it was told in the novel. It's quite impressive how closely the artists followed the images. Some were apparently changed a bit to make drawing easier and to make the scenery prettier. Some photos aren't quite the same because the seasons were probably different, but I gotta give this guy credit for doing all that. I have no idea how much time he spent just trying to find the place of interest, but it was probably an incredible amount of time and effort. Kudos to the fella.  
  
Groove coverage was right. God is a girl.
