Kagamine Rin and Hatsune Miku sold separately

  
These things are so cute I get a sugar rush just looking at them. I'm sure everyone remembered that video on youtube where all the figure that would be released were dancing the Caramelldansen. Well, here are two more of them! Pics after the jump.

Kagamine Len is quite the shota. His cuteness makes me wonder how easy it is to make otakus gay for him. Of course I do not swing that way (because I fapped to Rin) and I'm sure some of you female otakus out there are seriously falling head over heels with how cool Len actually gets in real life. Looks like its time for some spending again (I seriously have to do something about it before I end up like the guy at [11 - 15% suki](http://www.moyism.com/).

Rin on the other hand, is quite fappable. Her little clips holding her bangs to the side really stepped on my moe-meter and when I saw here with the microphone, I exploded. Nicest thing is... She has FANGS!!

Weird thing about these figures is that, they come with a blank face. Whats up with that? I heard its for modders but... hey I'm not sure about having to cut your own eyes and paint them into the face... My hand's not steady enough for that... I might end up with something like this:
