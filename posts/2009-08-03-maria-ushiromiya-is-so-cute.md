I mean, look at her. She is so cute. Look at those adorable babyteeth and see how joyfully she smiles. Truly an angel. Of course, I'm not endorsing pedophillia or anything, I am just a big fan of lolis. I mean, if you aren't you probably aren't human.

Now if only she were my other sister... Look at her when she looks upset. It just makes you want to hug her and tell her everything is alright.

Though that may not be the case in the context in this episode, she seems very happy that a witch has appeared in front of her. I'm not sure why Battler and the rest all feel so disturbed because I would probably feel so much better after I see her jump around in joy and laughter from the impending doom.

She's really obedient too. Which parent wouldn't want their daughter to obey them the moment they dress up like a witch? It makes parenting so much easier.

She even has an awesome serious face. I can so see her on the covers of CLEO and Fashion Magazine now.

Look at her when she's high on drugshappily declaring the gospel of the witch to the non-believers. She's so adorable!

Can you hear the golden butterflies?

I have always loved the life of rich families that have strict rules on how you sit and drink tea. The reason for this is better explained in the picture above. Look at Her Adorableness Ushiromiya Maria!

I give big big big kudos to Studio DEEN for making such an awesome Maria. I think she is more awesome in the anime than she is in the game. Just looking at her makes me want to adopt her off her dead parents lying in the garage. And that crown on her head is the icing on the cake. What better way to crown Her Adorableness than with a tiny little cast iron crown? Someone decent cosplay her PLEASE!
