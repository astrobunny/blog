A pair of failed RAM sticks, 2 nights of diagnostics, 4GB of RAM and over9000 hours of diagnostics later. I'm left with an OS I thought I'd never install \*cough\*vista\*cough\* and finding myself having to start from scratch with my software suite again. What a pain. Time to make BunnyBlogger more lightweight so I can use it without having to kick up the IDE.
