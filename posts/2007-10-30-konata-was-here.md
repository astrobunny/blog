Happiness is having melon-pan for lunch. I envy Sakai, getting a whole bunch of melon-pan from shana-chama and allowed to swallow them all for lunch... Ahh~ This world is not fair!

Of course, I had to go down to the city and grab myself some for myself coz I don't have a loli that would pack 5 melon-pans into a tiny bentobox for me. As you can see, Konata visited me too!
