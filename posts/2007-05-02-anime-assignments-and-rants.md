It really seems that anime has become an integral part of my life. Looking at my blog, I suddenly came to the ultimate realization... I have become AN OTAKU. OMG. This has become really sad. Anyway... on to the rant...<!--more-->  
  
Today, after 3 grinding hours of extreme lectures, I died from information overload and lived again. I then sat down in a quiet place in the DSL lab and attempted to do some more of the Lucky Star translation... unfortunately, I was so washed up that I only managed to do a few minutes of it... I knew I had to go home... But I still had another lecture at 3pm. So, I grabbed a bag of chips and went to the posters at hung on the wall in the ECE building reading about image reconstruction and damn accurate SONARs. Next thing I knew, I was trolling through the Mahora Academy forums and started to download the lots of Negima!? sprites on it. I seriously need a life.  
  
Damnit. This is the first time I felt free from assignments after having handed the Management one in, which was pretty much the last assessment in some time now. The next one will be a stupid project proposal which is basically just a confirmation that I am still alive, which I may not be anymore once I'm done with uni.  
  
SIGH... Life is hard. At least Japanese classes tomorrow morning will be a great start to the day, and I hopefully will be filled with life again... I hope. SIGH
