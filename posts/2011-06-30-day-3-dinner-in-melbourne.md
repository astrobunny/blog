Today in Chadstone Mall, we headed out for lunch and then went to watch Cars 2. Then we noticed Borders had a clearance sale, where they were literally clearing out their store, including furniture and all.<!--more--> [![](wp-uploads/2011/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0149-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2011/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0149.jpg)  
  
Electronics were going for like 1 or 2 dollars each. Of course, we bought them for the cables and stuff.

And I got some plastics to use as organizational tools.

But the highlight of the day was the little Japanese restaurant called Nagoya in Glen Huntly.

And the gyoza nice and rich! Except not cooked the normal Tokyo way.

Along with some Agedashi Tofu.

Not to mention Kaki Fly.

And tempura.

And the obligatory salmon.
