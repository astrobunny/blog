Imagine a niconico Medley with like... trap voices for the girls, or girls rapping out the guys' parts. This is gonna be so LoL. Read on and find out more!

**How to join?**  
  
In order to join, you must:  

  
- Be committed to singing your part properly ^\_^
  
- e-mail at niconicomedley@astrobunny.net with the subject title I want to join the NicoNico Medley
  
- Tell me your gender
  
- Tell me your name XD
  
- Send in your singing voice without the Karaoke music so it can be edited on top of a high-quality version. Try and make sure its a format like mp3 or ogg so we can use it!
  
- Come to the IRC Channel #niconicomedley @ irc.irchighway.net to chat with us!
  
  
More than one person can sing a part, and once there are more than 32 people, one person can sing more than a part. This post will be edited to reflect the current song allocations. What happens is, once we're done, we will confirm everyone's places and everyone can send in their mp3 voices (without the music) for their parts, and it will be thrown in into a massive edit to produce an mp3 no one will ever forget.  
  
Finally, we need the
