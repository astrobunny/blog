"Hayate's ending was so sweet. We finally see Nagi kiss Hayate secretly when he's sleeping. I was so happy for her. On the other hand, Canaan was getting so sad. I hope Maria will be alright... It kinda make me start thinking about how short our lives are"

"You know... there's so much to do, but all the shows just remind us how fragile we are, and how we're going to end up not being able to do all of the stuff we wanna do. I just hope nothing fatal will happen to us in the new future... If something did happen to you I'd cry my lungs out."
