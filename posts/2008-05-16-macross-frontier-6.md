Man... This is the best episode so far. It started with Ranka getting a manager, but the best part was not there. Beware. Spoilers ahead.

Recon units were sent to a point 12 lightyears away, where they rendezvoused with a ship from Macross Galaxy and apparently beaten up badly by the Vajra. Captain Wilder, recieving the news from the recon team, then planned to leave Macross Frontier to assist them, having Cathy as temporary first commander.

Sheryl, being intimidated by the situation at hand, knowing what is happening to Galaxy, decides to go on with the concert. Alto, having seen Sheryl to pass her her earring, left with it. Sheryl obviously wanted to tell him more than what she did, or give him more than an earring at that stage, but couldn't. Alto, rushed back to the cruiser before it left and went into standby for battle. Something is obviously happening between the two. Alto put the earring on the side of his HUD and started up the VT.

The Captain ordered the ship out of Macross Frontier's bays and prepared for a fold. I always thought one of the bridge bunnies were strange. Apparently she has the same all-black eyes that were once owned by Emil Lang and Lazlo Zand. It makes her look kinda creepy. Sheryl begins to sing as Ranka makes her way to the concert hall. The scene was surreal. It really looked like a scene from Macross where Minmei started singing while a war was waged outside the SDF.

Then, the dramatic signature of the Macross series, the star sings a sad song as the technoknights depart for yet another battle. The cruiser speeds away from the ship to fold distance as Sheryl sings towards her chorus. The fold begins and Ranka notices. And she sang...
