Ok here's probably the last of a series of very closely spaced posts on figmas after my figma shopping spree. Today we'll open the entire cast of Lucky Star characters and put them on my shelf. I got this from beNippon if you were curious, and they've been very honest with me, even refunding some of my shipping when they charged too much. Kudos to them and honest traders for the win.

The packaging for this figma has been done very nicely and thought and care has obviously been put into ensuring that it got to me in the very condition they were shipped.

Two pieces of cardboard and lots of tape and bubble wrap really takes out almost all the worry of any shock ever getting to the figmas.

Woo hoo. Open open!  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4067-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4067.jpg)  
  
Yes. The 4 main characters of Lucky Star. Konata, Kagamin, Tsukasa and Miyuki.

Here you can see how the boxes were nicely separated using a piece of tissue paper. This is what I call attention to detail.

Alright. Let's get on to the actual meat. The 4 boxes were designed to be put together so that one of their sides will form a whole complete picture of all of them. This however, I'm sure isn't the last of the Lucky Star figmas. I'm anticipating the Background Combo and Yutaka and Minami to appear as figmas in not too long.

All my figma boxes. This pile is getting big, and will grow bigger over the course of this year I assure you. The Konami box really doesn't fit in does it? Ara! Did you notice an extra box I haven't talked about yet? XD  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4177-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4177.jpg)  
  
Miyuki box front. You can see relatively clearly that there are drawings of the four girls on the surface of the plastic. In this case Miyuki is highlighted. Awesome reminder. She comes with a book to read. How... characteristic of her.

The back of the box. As usual showing the warnings that figmas are not for kids and the bill of materials.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4180-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4180.jpg)  
  
The brand that says pretty much all.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4181-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4181.jpg)  
  
Top top of the box. It looks the same as the bottom, so I'm not gonna post that anymore (I should set a gallery up for this stuff). Also, you've seen the other side already when I put the 4 boxes together.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4197-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4197.jpg)  
  
Tsukasa's box. She's got a phone! Talk about comic relief. I think we're gonna have to protect it from the washing machine.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4199-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4199.jpg)  
  
Back of the box  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4200-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4200.jpg)  
  
Ok so you see a pattern now: all the lucky star boxes have the same left side. They've painted a little tree Lucky Star style on the left. I wished they would get a bit more creative, but oh well. At least all the boxes look good.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4201-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4201.jpg)  
  
Here's the top of the box. It looks the same from the bottom.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4190-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4190.jpg)  
  
Konata. She comes with a choco coronet. Yum yum. Reminder to self: I need to get a few more this saturday.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4193-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4193.jpg)  
  
The back of the box showing Konata and her random antics.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4195-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4195.jpg)  
  
The top of the box. Okay. This is getting tedious. I should really get a gallery set up. You'll hear from me soon about it.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4183-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4183.jpg)  
  
And last, but not least, Kagamin's box!  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4186-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4186.jpg)  
  
And for completeness's sake... The accompanying pictures. Something interesting about this Kagamin is that I actually decided to buy her only AFTER she was sold out. I panicked and looked everywhere since I already had Konata, Tsukasa and Miyuki available, I felt that if I didn't get Kagamin, it would be completely meaningless to get the other three. Okay maybe Konata, but still, without Kagamin, she would be so ronery. It would be like Nanoha without Fate.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4189-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4189.jpg)  
  
I looked and looked at various online stores, play asia, yesasia, hlj, the j-list, toylet, hobbysearch, benippon, etc etc, and none of them had them new! I was almost at the end of my wits and beNippon only had a used Kagamin. Desperate, I decided to just go with it.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4208-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4208.jpg)  
  
These cardboard pictures come with each of the figmas. Although the item was listed as 2nd hand, it actually turned out that when they shipped it to me, they shipped a brand new box, which actually came as a pleasant surprise for me. That's why I'm recommending the shop big time now.

Miyuki comes with this background that's the same as the one in the Lucky Star OP, so you can go ahead and remake the OP yourself!

The Lucky Star figmas lined up.  
  
\*WHAT?! NO MORE PICTURES!?\*  
  
Calm down. I really wanted to take some more, but for some reason my camera just decided to go flat all of a sudden. Will post more when I get the chance to do something fun with them! XD
