Last autumn [me and Kagami went to the New Brighton beach](http://www.astrobunny.net/2009/04/13/new-brighton-beach/) for a nice relaxing day trip. This summer however, we went again, this time a Konata tagged along to accompany Kagami.

Kagami lookin' pretty at the beach. This time, we started on the north part of the beach, and gradually headed south where the pier was.

We found a funny fish thingy on the sidewalk.

There were some old run down buildings titled "OZONE"  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0527-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0527.jpg)  
  
We even found a funny statue sitting just near the carpark.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0531-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0531.jpg)  
  
So we decided to sit on its face and take photos  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0532-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0532.jpg)  
  
To give you an idea of what they were really sitting on...

More fish stickers on the walkway curbs

Konata tried to press the water fountain, so Kagami challenged her to actually put water in her mouth.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0541-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0541.jpg)  
  
She wasn't very successful though...  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0547-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0547.jpg)  
  
While I chilled out on the rocks at the beach, Kagami and Konata wandered around looking down strange holes. Lucky they didn't fall into any of them. It would've been troublesome.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0554-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0554.jpg)  
  
Enjoying the view from the stairs of the sports center.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0559-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0559.jpg)  
  
At the top of the sports center, Konata continues to irritate Kagami by getting too hyped up.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0571-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0571.jpg)  
  
We also spotted some saltwater flowers by the beach. They grow out of the sand!  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0572-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0572.jpg)  
  
And there were some really suspicious looking pieces of wood lying around in the sand.

Chilling out on the broken sign before continuing our little walk to the pier beach.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0580-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0580.jpg)  
  
We had some more walking to do before reaching the pier, which can be seen in the distance.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0595-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0595.jpg)  
  
I found a stick and made a signature in the sand. Tell me if you actually saw it in real life! You would have seen what I looked like if you did.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0597-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0597.jpg)  
  
Of course, Kagami was here too.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0602-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0602.jpg)  
  
Here people just strip their clothes and run off into the sea naked. That's right. The water was only about 10 degrees celcius at the time I took this photo.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0604-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0604.jpg)  
  
We even found a little sand castle (mound?) and decided to conquer it!  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0609-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0609.jpg)  
  
After that we finally arrived at the oh so familiar pier beach area.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0613-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0613.jpg)  
  
Then we took a nice memorable picture with the Lolwhale.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0617-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0617.jpg)  
  
There's the pier! Lets go! The guy in black walking towards us actually drew something in the sand. Check it out:  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0619-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0619.jpg)  
  
Pretty cool huh?  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0641-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0641.jpg)  
  
Alas, it was soon time for dinner, so we decided to make a move.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0644-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_DSC_0644.jpg)  
  
Had a little sit around to look at the beach one last time before leaving.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_100_8102-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/02/wpid-sml_100_8102.jpg)  
  
Was really hungry, so we had some nice oily food after that. Of course, topped off with nice healthy green tea.
