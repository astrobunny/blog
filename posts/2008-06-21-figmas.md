I've recently acquired some figmas, a Haruhi, Nagato and Nanoha. All made by my favorite toy manufacturer, Max Factory. I learned lots of things about figmas and how they were made to be photogenic and not for being stared at while you're fapping under your trousers. More pictures after the jump. Was busy today so I didn't manage to give the figures a proper unpacking ceremony and welcome them properly into the family by giving them numerous photography shots worthy of a gravure idol. Will post more soon.

My girlfriend's busy opening the box up. Looks like they secured it quite well. Sasuga figure vendors.

All the three boxes were nicely shrink wrapped on to a cardboard platform, which makes them nice and secure.
