Here are some life lessons from Minamike 10 which everyone should find very indispensible and useful to advancing in society.

1. First and foremost, you must always SMILE.

2. You must always remember the much obliged present. Ensure that it is something of significant value to the other side.

3. If the person whom you have business with has a cute and loveable sister, you must make sure she does not feel comfortable with your presence. This distraction to the person may coax him/her to lower their resistance toward your request.
