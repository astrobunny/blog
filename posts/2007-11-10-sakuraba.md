ああ。桜庭だ。です。  
Aa. Sakuraba da. desu.  
  
今日はリハーセルな問なので確認程度で気軽によろしく…  
Kyou wa Rehearsal na mon nano de, kakunin teido de kigaru ni yoroshiku  
  
おねがいします。  
onegaishimasu.  
  
おぉ白石後頼む  
oo Shiraishi ato tanomu.  
  
後は基本的に白石に任せるので、何があったらいつけろてください。  
Ato wa kihonteki ni Shiraishi ni makaseru no de, naniga attara, itsukero te kudasai.  
  
どうかしたか？？です。  
douka shitaka?? desu.  
  
I have never seen someone crossing out so much of their talking. I noticed Strato having a hard ball of a time trying to translate it. Though, its Japanese honorifics we're talking about here, so only those who know what's going on would find it funny. So I thought I'd just write out exactly what's going on in this situation.  
  
Well, in Japanese, there are 2 forms of verbs in general use. One is the polite form, and one is the plain form. The polite sentences end with "desu" or "masu" or "verb-te kudasai". The plain of casual forms end with "da" or "ru" or "verb-te" or "verb-ro". So you can see that she's trying to add stuff to the back to make it polite, although its obvious she wasn't being polite in the first place.  
  
It's like saying "SHUT UP... ... please"  
and "I AM THE KING... ... ... ... ... pleased to meet you"  
  
In the first sentence, she tells Akira her name is Sakuraba.  
"Sakuraba desu" is polite  
"Sakuraba da" is casual. In formal situations it is considered impolite. She is obviously not used to it, so she goes  
  
"Sakuraba da... ... desu"  
  
And in the second one she goes:  
  
Yoroshiku... ... onegaishimasu.  
  
Which in this context means, I'm counting on you. Yoroshiku alone would be considered casual. Simply adding onegaishimasu makes it polite.  
  
In the 4th sentence, she goes  
  
"Naniga attara itsukero... ... te kudasai"  
  
If there is anything just tell him... ... please.  
  
"kudasai" can be translated to "please". Though it is a very low level "please", it is a very common "please".  
  
So Sakuraba is just playing the role of a "I'm only polite because I want to, not because of where I stand" character. But I wasn't sure the translations done by a.f.k. conveyed it all that well, so I thought I'd do my part and explain it.
