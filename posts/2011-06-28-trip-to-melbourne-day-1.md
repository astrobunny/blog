Headed to Melbourne today, because I felt like it. Kagami and Akai helped me out a lot with packing for this trip. The first today was of course, Christchurch airport, where I departed.<!--more--> [![](wp-uploads/2011/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0004-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2011/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0004.jpg)  
  
Of course, Drossel helped too. She was finding it funny why different countries used different coloured passports. I guess computers don't get the idea of "arbitrary".

First thing I noticed when I got to the airport: They renovated the airport!

We decided to go around and browse the new second floor a bit.

Had a bit of breakfast, and then boarded the plane.

Fast forward to 3 hours later when I finally woke up from my knockout and saw the Melbourne city skyline in the distance beyond the morning fog.

Its been a while since I've seen such a busy airport.

Lots of Chinese was written in the arrival halls. I guess Chinese is very important here now.

Akai found a lost me and picked me up and hauled me up a bus to the Southern Cross station.

I found it interesting that they had some very elaborate human traffic control apparatuses at the railroad crossings.

And some very mad graffiti. THIS IS MELBOURNE!!!!

As luck would have it, hot and spicy chicken was out when I was on my trip here. Since I was yearning hard for hot and spicy after KFC in New Zealand stopped offering it, I was overjoyed and decided to go for it.

And the wolf brought me around to see his university, Monash.

_Akai what are you d...._  
  
There was this cute minecraft-ish man in in the quad.

And finally we headed up to a carpark in the university to catch a glimpse of the sunset.
