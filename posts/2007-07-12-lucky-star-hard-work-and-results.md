I'm not sure what's going on here but the comics seem to be following the course of my life. Every title for the past few strips seem to be relevant to what I'm doing right now. This is freaky. Anyway, yep results don't come without hard work. Though, Tsukasa is really a mirror of me. I always plan but never do it. SIGH. I gotta discipline myself more.
