Yep this is a post about nothing. There are days when your mind goes blank and you simply don't have anything to write about, or you couldn't be bothered looking too far for material. Well, this is what you do when you have nothing to write about. Just make something up, or do something else. For me, I've had the chance to talk to a fairly inspirational guy known as Aroduc, and he told me to write about nothing, so I did.

Times when there's nothing are sometimes good since it helps you relax and think about those things you never quite have the time to think about. It helps keep get you meditating about deeper things such as where your life is going in general, and what you should do for your anime blog. When there's nothing, its often good to sit back and relax, and just not think about anything at all. Or perhaps do something you always wanted to do, or practice something you always wanted to practice.

Perhaps what I'm really getting across is that there never is nothing to post about, or nothing to think about or nothing to do for that matter. I for one believe that life really can't be long enough, and I always wish for 25 hour days. Just give me that extra hour to do so much more stuff, and I'll be so happy. Though, its precisely because time is precious we professionals get paid so much.

Why then, do people say they are bored, or that they have nothing to do? From experience, I can say that its really only because they just couldn't be bothered looking for something to do. Haruhi-chan teaches us a great lesson here, when she turned down the Computer Club president for the first time, and then said she was bored. It honestly reminded me so much of myself I felt like I was looking in the mirror at that instant.

So, for those of you who are feeling bored now: nani ga shitai no kana? kana?
