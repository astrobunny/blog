Time for me to publish an utterly pointless and random post with a collection of figma pictures I took. I tried my best to put together a story but ended up with some sort of writer block.

"Yeah I know she was all scared and all by that big guy who confessed to her. I wonder how she'll take it. I hope he doesn't do silly stuff to her."  
"But why her?"  
"Maybe he saw her cosplaying once. I dunno, some boys fall in love with cosplayers for some reason. I don't really understand either."  
"SERIOUSLY!? It just makes girls who cosplay seem desperate."
