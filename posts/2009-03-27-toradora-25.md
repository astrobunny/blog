Ok, so I'll say this first, this post is a complete 100% spoiler post. If you haven't watched 25, clicking Continue Reading will kill all the thrill Toradora ever built up. Hell, if you're still reading on anyway proceed at your own risk.

First of all, I think Yasuko in her non-slut mode is actually extremely pretty. In this scene she reminded me a LOT of Alicia from ARIA. It actually made me realize that even though she's the kind of mother she is, and acts childish and all, she is still, after all a grownup, and has been through more than most of us can only imagine. At the beginning of the series I must admit I didn't think much of her, but this scene made me realize that, no matter what she seemed like in the series, she's raised Ryuuji all the way without him going bad. Ryuuji's right, I think that's something pretty damn respectable no matter how you look at it. Just think of the number of parents who failed doing that.

Now, on to the lovebirds. The reason why Toradora trumps 90% of all anime love stories in my books is because this anime has closure. That's right. Closure. Unlike other harem stories where the guy is undecided and STAYS undecided all the way to the end of the freakin undecided story, and still stays undecided with girls around him continuing to say "MAKENAI WA!" or continuing to dote on the guy until their lives end of old age, this one actually has an end to the love triangle, with the characters finally deciding who the right person for them is. The director has truly chosen to end this once and for all and close off the story before it gets long ang boring, and I think that even though we will miss the cast, its probably the best way to go.  
  
I can't say however, that I like how this ended. For one Taiga didn't get as much screentime as I'd hoped, and there was nothing after Ryuuji and Taiga grew up or anything. Oh well, maybe the rest lies in the manga? Someone tell me if that's the case.

Unlike a lot of hollywood movies or ero-game based/seinen/shoujo anime, the kissing scenes are left right to the end. This is the best thing about being Asian, the racy part always comes at the end, because realistically, people frown upon acts of courtship at the shallow stages of a relationship. People will only root for it once its grown deep enough, and its taken such a long time for them to get together and muster the courage to do it to each other. Though, I felt a bit confused and awkward when I saw this because it felt sudden and they were acting like mere platonic friends not too long ago. I guess the night tends to get people in the mood.  
  
Oh, and don't get me started about the no-sex thing. Being a teenager before I'm sure you guys can imagine the atmosphere at the time if YOU were in their shoes (or blankets, whichever way you want to think about it).

This scene is a really good painting of how much Taiga and Ryuuji were meant for each other. Holding hands takes quite a lot of courage (I can hear westerners laughing at us Asians now) because like I said before, public acts of affection isn't something people around you are usually comfortable with. That's why I think that it shows how close they are and how close they should be. I must admit, only the dragon can equal the tiger.

Yukari-sensei also earned my attention this episode. Her little speech about crossroads in life really got me thinking. Sure enough, those crossroads tend to force you to make a decision, and its those decisions which will completely change the course of your life one bit at a time. Most of these decisions don't make or break your well being of course, but some really put so much impact on you it takes some real willpower to climb up again.   
  
I think that Taiga's choice of transferring and living with her mom has plenty of wisdom in it. It would be terrible to get married if your mom despised you. Her decision to reconcile herself with her family is nothing short of admirable. Reconciliation even during awkwardness has never not been good in my experience, and though we may offend or cast of another person, reconciliation is always a good thing, since everyone wants life to change for the better.  
  
It seems a lot of side characters have been earning my attention in this series. They all seem to be developing so well in the background, no wonder so many other bloggers actually also start talking about the less-noticed side characters. If anything, Toradora has done more for its side characters than probably 90% of the anime I've watched.

Group photos are the best. They also represent a form of closure that will mark a part of everyone's life. In this case, we get a half naked Kitamura, which will instead scar all of us for the rest of our lives. ;) Aroduc. Not that it's a bad thing though.

...and living abroad really isn't anything to be proud of, but I guess if you're going on a big prestigious scholarship and you're Japanese, its probably a different story.

Teachers always look so proud and so happy about their students during their graduation. Perhaps its because its because it also represents a form of closure for them, showing them that they have indeed succeeded in raising good students, even though some haven't really been 'raised'... ah you get what I mean.

Also, it seems a lot of things can happen in one whole year. Maya and whatshisface are going all dere dere with each other now. Even though it seemed like a flash to us, they must've been really busy this year. Oh how I wish for a sequel now. Toradora ~After Story~

Finally, Taiga returns, and it seems that she's sorted everything out on her side, and comes back from a school whose uniforms are sailor uniforms (KYAAA~). Somehow, she doesn't look extremely cute in this uniform. Its probably because I'm used to seeing her in a coat and everything, but oh well. Zettais, DFC, Serafuku and tsundere all in one is any anime fan's definition of perfection. Ahh yes, good things truly come in small packages.

P.S. Our loveable home parrot seems to have finally passed the JLPT lvl 100. Good Job Inko-chan on finally being able to say your own name! Time to get it a square hat and a certificate too.
