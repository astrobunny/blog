Alright. I didn't have much time to blog about this but, ITS HERE!!! For the very first time, I bought something from overseas. I never really trusted online commerce, but I decided to give it a little try anyway, so I went down to Amazon.  
  
So basically, the first thing I looked for, as an otaku in the making was DVDs. Unfortunately, their price tags (given the number of episodes on each of them) were so large they could burn holes in my pocket. I went over to the soundtracks then, and saw quite a few things I liked. So I ordered.  
  
Several days later the dreaded software assignment came and sucked a few days out of my life. Fortunately as soon as all that toiling ended, a very very welcome knock on the door occured at 6.30 am.  
  
THEY ARE HERE!!!!

As I opened the door hoping for heaven to come down, the wonderful postman brought the shining box out of the van and had me sign a wonderful looking electronic signature pad and said a wonderful "have a good day!" and gave me the wonderful box.

Good things come to those who wait and omg I waited for many many weeks for this to get here. I ordered in April. And it was just wonderful. I jumped in and immediately tore the package up and saw the very things I ordered lying inside
