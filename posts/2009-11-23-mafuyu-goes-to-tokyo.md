First of all, I didn't know you could eat corn like this. I always chew at it. But I guess refined ladies must daintily pick out the individual corn bits off the column and chew them slowly. Touching corn was a no-no for me because I always had lots of butter on it.

I get the feeling that my suitcase is also going to be full of game hardware. Mafuyu is my role model now for me to follow before my trip to Tokyo.

I must also be gar and carry weapons too. But I don't think they would tolerate that on airplanes nowadays.

Though I think Mafuyu has got a really good sense of fashion, something seems out in this one she is wearing~gyaku ni.

I predict a tenfold increase in the number of Mafuyu's fans from today onwards.
