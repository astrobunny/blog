Kyoto Animation has done it again. My moe levels have reached an all-time high with the entrance of the Fujibayashi twins and the new star-carving girl who really really really made me wanna go uguu.

Nagisa's got a nice family too! I can't imagine seeing my whole family put their fists up and shouting something like "Go!" or something like that. It just feels really uncool. Its been a really long while since I had dinner with my family too. This picture just make me miss family all the more...  
  
 [![We Are Family!](http://gallery.astrobunny.net/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=1023&g2_serialNumber=2)](http://gallery.astrobunny.net/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=1021 "We Are Family!")  
  
Gosh I wish I lived in anime. You get the awesome l33t hit combo bar when you do massive hits, like what Tomoyo is doing. OMG she can so kick ass. =.=; Why is it that it is always girls that can kick ass.  
  
 [![A girl Jet Li](http://gallery.astrobunny.net/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=1017&g2_serialNumber=2)](http://gallery.astrobunny.net/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=1015 "A girl Jet Li")  
  
Fujibayashi Ryou is the cutest moest kawaiiest anime gurl eva. I want my fortune told by her too. It seems when a girl tells you what will happen, it WILL happen. Its almost as if destiny listens to moe girls.  
  
 [![We Are Family!](http://gallery.astrobunny.net/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=1026&g2_serialNumber=2)](http://gallery.astrobunny.net/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=1024 "We Are Family!")  
  
These are only what I think. I'm sure lots of people don't agree with me, but hell I'm so sold on CLANNAD now. Why can't other companies make anime this perfect!? It just doesn't make sense that KyoAni is winning all my favoritism when there are plenty of other good pictures out there but they strike no effect. There must be someone... somewhere out there that can actually rival this kind of masterful animation. WOOT.
