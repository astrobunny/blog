Yes. The moment of truth has come. Today, 2 CDs which are very important to the wellbeing of otakus all over the world have just come out to tame their insatiable need for the full, lossless, quality and fullness of the music constantly mixed in with a flurry of wonderful images of their favorite characters in every opening sequence. Yes. Today, is the release date for Motteke! Se-ra-fuku and Hayate no Gotoku singles. I bet the CD stores in Japan won't even need to allocate shelves for these 2 CDs, since they will be taken the moment they come out of the boxes.  
  
Now that these are released, all I have to wait for is another one more that I've been wanting to listen to too. Its Hayate no Gotoku's ED theme music Proof by Mize.
