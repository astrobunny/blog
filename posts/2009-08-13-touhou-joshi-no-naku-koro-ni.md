Studio DEEN's stealing SHAFT's stick, and taking notes from KyoAni's past shows. Okay okay. I know I'm late. I'm slowpoke.gif. Though its always refreshing to have some colour thrown into an anime that's trying to do some sort of mystery/detective/mind game story, I'm still having a very hard time following the story.

Most people go and start telling me to play the game. Well, okay, once I get some free time. I'm not an uni student anymore so I don't have entire days to myself. The only time I can spare for recreation goes almost solely towards watching anime and reading lots of other blogs. Why do I waste time on this show? Well, its because I like the OP.

Studio DEEN also made a very good and very realistic depiction of the real-life situation of cosplay, which I must admit, despite not being the best eye candy in the world, is still quite amusing to talk about.

I must really start learning how to do some serious mods on my figmas.
