Yes. I succumbed to the dark side, and I got myself a Mac. To be honest, I am quite pleased with it. There have been a few issues with it though, such as the absence of a decent MSN client (that has webcamming abilities) and a decent MKV decoder. I know about Perian but it does not decode my Macross Frontier episodes (1280x720) fast enough, and Macross Frontier cannot be watched at 5 fps, though it does pr0n Kanokon AVIs pretty decently.  
  
PC feels awfully insecure now that the mac is sitting next to it, taking all the table space next to it, causing it to be THE place where I now throw all my stuff, including my girlfriend's stuff when she comes around. I should make a Mac PC video sometime.  
  
I must say something about the speech recognition thing built into OS X though. Although cool, and free, the speech recognition kinda sucks at decoding my Malaysian accent. I always have to act out my quasi-american accent to be able to get it to work, but even so it works like only 10% of the time. My advice to Steve: MAKE IT BETTER SO I CAN TELL IT TO BUGGER OFF WITHOUT TOUCHING IT. Why would I not want to touch it? Well just look at it! It gets dirty every for every third speck of dust that falls on it, and is the ultimate fingerprint magnet at the moment (my PC is the current number 2). I wiped it 5 times ever since I got it.  
  
All in all however, it is one lovely working/blogging machine. It is difficult to find games for it, difficult to get distracted from doing anything not work related on it and damn easy to switch between applications through Expose. The Mac lets you do your work only, and does that very well by leaving little to be desired. I find that most of the time I spend on my PC is finding a better piece of software or plugin to do something, and ending up looking at things that seem interesting, but are really JAPOC (just another piece of crap). On a Mac, I just don't get that feeling. Thus, in short, I am just so friggin productive on it.  
  
If I ever make a living off this blog someday, the Mac is probably gonna be my favorite machine.
