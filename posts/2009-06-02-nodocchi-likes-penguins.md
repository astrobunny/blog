It seems Nodoka's penguin ownership is not limited to Pen-Pen. She also have a Rubber Penguini to accompany her in the bath.

I still don't know why I get the feelings of raeg when I see Nodoka and Saki go all lovey dovey. I mean I like yuri and all, and the embarassment girls radiate when being violated by their own gender etc etc. But somehow Nodoka x Saki doesn't sit well with me.
