Latest fresh from the Tokyo Animation is the latest would be craze full of more school life randomness brought in by hastily sketched characters in sailor uniforms! Enter Lucky Star! Mahora Fansubs are gonna pull out Ep 1 in no time for all of you otakus out there, or so I'm informed. So while you're waiting, here's the OP from Lucky Star! The opening song is Motteke! Seifuku by (guess what) Aya Hirano from Haruhi... WOOT. Enjoy.
