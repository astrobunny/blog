If there's one thing I must say about Railgun, its how well Misaka fits with Touma. Simply looking at how well they get along shows that there is just so much to make fun of. The storytellers need to be a little more creative.

Though with all of Touma's goodwill and trying to get by by himself, we still get all sorts of comedy from Misaka's stubbornly wanting to exert her powers on those who foolishly think she's just another distressed middle school girl walking around alone.

But I always look forward to her thunderstorms.

And her tsun explosions

And dere blackouts.

And at the rate they are going around meeting each other

I think we don't need a Yuki Nagato to figure out how it will all end.

She even longs to hold his hand.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Mazui_To_Aru_Kagaku_no_Railgun_-_04_F9E68ACA_12-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Mazui_To_Aru_Kagaku_no_Railgun_-_04_F9E68ACA_12.jpg)  
  
But never thinks about the consequences first.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Mazui_To_Aru_Kagaku_no_Railgun_-_04_F9E68ACA_13-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Mazui_To_Aru_Kagaku_no_Railgun_-_04_F9E68ACA_13.jpg)  
  
And then blows up because of what she did.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Mazui_To_Aru_Kagaku_no_Railgun_-_04_F9E68ACA_15-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Mazui_To_Aru_Kagaku_no_Railgun_-_04_F9E68ACA_15.jpg)  
  
Gosh she's cute beyond words. Touma calls himself unlucky. I'm sure the majority of us think otherwise.

And we all know who's the real unlucky one.
