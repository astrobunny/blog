After looking at Shance's [failsketch of what he calls "Loli Tohsaka Rin"](http://rainbowsphere.oniichannoecchi.com/archives/2319), and as a fan of Fate/Stay Night's young genius sorceress and romantic target, I felt obliged to salvage whatever was left of Rin's cuteness and lovability in a sketch I did after having finally found my pencil box.  
  
Like Rin-chan said: ONII CHAN NO BAKA!!
