Recently I've been coming around to do some translation checking for Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch. Yes I know the name sounds awfully 1970's and Sailormoonish, I thought so too until I saw the anime. I assure you the name does not do quite as much justice to the show as Gundam Seed did for Gundam Seed Destiny. In other words, it's not so bad since the girls in there are surprisingly moe.

These are the mermaid princesses.  
  
The story revolves around a group of mermaids which are one among the many mermaids in the world seeking the 7 mermaid pearls to revive the Goddess Aqua Regina (yes, for those of you so technically inclined, it sounds like the name of a solvent that dissolves gold) and to restore peace to the seas and drive away the sea monsters.

Here are a couple of sea monsters whose picture the daring crew from discovery channel sacrificed their lives for.  
  
Actually, these are the few villains in the anime world who actually look cute. I mean, can anyone please list me a bunch of recent anime with villains as cute as these? Well, maybe this anime isn't quite as new as \<3 Macross Frontier \<3 or Code Geass 2, but they certainly involve modern cel-shading and not the old technicolor of the original Macross. (I like the yellow haired villain. She's hitting high on my moe meter)

When it comes to battles, the mermaid princesses go into hostile mode. They really look hostile. Even more so than their enemies. I like the purple haired one in this case. She looks like she was really really offended. Like, offended in many many unimaginable ways, but still willing to go on with something personal that I will not discuss here. Anyway, if you wanted to know what they do to battle their enemies, I'd rather not tell you, but if you really want to know...

They sing. Its lame right? They SING. I wonder what part of that would defeat their enemies? Maybe lightning would strike because it just rained from their singing. Of course, I'm only joking. They just make their enemies even more moe and make them blush to death.

Of course, this anime also has its cute points.
