The figma scene's been slow lately so there aren't a lot of new ones to talk about, but I actually haven't opened my Signum yet. I'll leave it till later when I feel more motivated, more recently however, I managed to get my hands on a figma Konata and Yutaka. Yes. I know the box says Izumi Konata, but the reason I add the Yutaka is because even if its just the head, we all know that an anime character's identity really only resides in the hair and eyes. Everything else is a variable.

Well the figma package isn't the most exciting. Max factory glued a left hand to the figma shopping bag and that was pretty stupid, but oh well. Anyone can make a real shopping bag made of real paper with a real poster inside that can be held with the right hand, so no complaints there.

However, minus the shopping bag, the package is pretty boring except for the summer uniform and the Yutaka head, so this is going to be quite a short post. It was nice to get another Konata head though. Not that I don't have enough of them...

I was hoping that they would package more faces with the figmas, like the first Haruhi that had like 3 faces. Admittedly, this one is one of the few boxes that has lots of faces on them, Max factory seems to be trying to add value by making a blank face and giving you stickers to put on them. An obviously popular move when the nendoroid Rin came out.

"This is my cousin, Yutaka"  
"Nice to meet you, Hiiragi-senpai."

"You a first year, Yutaka-chan?"  
"Yep"

"Ah well you see, its getting hot and all so I thought I'd change early. (￣ω￣.)"

"Anyway that concludes today's little filler post just to meet the one post a day target. Be sure to tune in next time for more Figma Channel! We will start coming to you two or three days a week, hopefully, if the camera manages to function properly at the time!"  
  
... Anyway, I have to update the Flash Player now (-\_-メ)
