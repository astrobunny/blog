There should've been a better picture here, but I ended up having to use the older one I drew yesterday, because I lost my last one on a browser crash. It was meant to be this post's picture too, but since it was a comment post, not a trace of it was left. I guess stuff like this happens. But on the bright side, I just unearthed 300 soldiers of Cirno celebrating her Perfect Math Class on a hiroba of Aichi. Check it out.
