I paid a visit to my favorite beach again at New Brighton. Just walking down the beach with the wind in your face is the most awesome thing ever.

Of course, Kagami came too.

The beach in the evening is awesome.

The pier from below. We didn't walk on it today

Because it was winter, the sun was really low in the sky so you could see your shadow cast for miles.

There were lots of birds too, attempting to fly into the wind

We just chilled out at the playground.
