Being the Electrical Engineering student that I am, I am required to acquire a large range of skills over the length of my study here in university. One of them is the skill to write software. Yes. The skill to make the hardware that we all so know and love, work. This year, one of our software assignments is to create our own graphical game. Yes graphical game. We were required to write up the specs of a game we were gonna write and actually, write it, test it and document it. Its awesome...  
  
... at first thought.  
  
Thus, I decided that I gotta make something cool. I wanted the WOW to start NOW. LMAO. So I decided, a simple strategy game should be pretty easy, since it only requires the use of a few units to fill the game up, corrdinates, battle algorithms and not much else. I went on and designed one and then wrote up a spec. In no time at all, I was already into building up the GUI from scratch, well, with a GUI library of course duh.  
  
... and thus how I spent the last few days toiling away on a project that is supposed to be easy lol. The lack of posts bear witness to this. I can't believe I made myself do this.  
  
One thing's a relief though, my DVDs are coming tomorrow!!!! XDXDXD (happy)
