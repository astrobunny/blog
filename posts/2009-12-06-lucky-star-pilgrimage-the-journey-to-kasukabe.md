Its one of those times when you leave on a trip and everything goes haywire. My site was down for two whole days and that made me go WTF all night for the past two nights because I couldn't tell anyone how much fun it was on my blog. But I can finally do that today. I went on the legendary Lucky Star pilgrimage through Kasukabe and Washinomiya because I love Kagamin.

We lived near the Asakusa station, so we only had to walk a short while before reaching this building.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0343-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0343.jpg)  
  
Bought a ticket to Kasukabe, where we are going to see 2 sceneries used in the Lucky Star OP, and the high school that Konata goes to was based off.

But I had a slight obstacle before me: I didn't know what kind of timing I need to jump through those gates. It must be some sort of Japanese thing.

Then we took the train bound for Kuki  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0380-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0380.jpg)  
  
... and went off.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0397-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0397.jpg)  
  
The ride to Kasukabe took about 1 hour from Asakusa. My companions were overjoyed when they saw the signboard because they (obviously) haven't been on a train for such a long time at once.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0398-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0398.jpg)  
  
Then we went out the east exit  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0579-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0579.jpg)  
  
Obviously, the extended roof was either not there when the artists took the photograph or they left it out.

Shortly after that, we headed for the school Konata's school was based on. Based on the ancient writings of past pilgrims, I was able to collect a rough journal of the journey to the school and how to get there.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0406-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0406.jpg)  
  
First, I walked down the main street right across the roundabout outside the station.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0411-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0411.jpg)  
  
Halfway, we found this restaurant with something really interesting on it.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0413-500x752.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0413.jpg)  
  
After I saw this I knew I was on the right track.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0436-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0436.jpg)  
  
Soon we reached a junction where there was this Esso petrol station and continued straight down the road.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0445-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0445.jpg)  
  
The Taisho Park was at the end of the street.   
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0450-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0450.jpg)  
  
The next thing we did was turn right and followed the road until we hit a junction to the left.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0453-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0453.jpg)  
  
We kept walking until we arrived at a junction with mirrors at its end.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0458-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0458.jpg)  
  
We turned right into the junction until we hit a fire station.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0461-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0461.jpg)  
  
After continuing down the road beside the fire station...  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0471-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0471.jpg)  
  
When we got to a large pylon, we turned left and walked down the road all the way.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0475-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0475.jpg)  
  
While we were walking down that road we were looking right and discovered a very familiar sight.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0487-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0487.jpg)  
  
It turned out to be a middle school and not a high school like in Lucky Star.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0496-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0496.jpg)  
  
Miyuki came running out to greet us  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0512-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0512.jpg)  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-Arigatou.Lucky.Star.Ep18.x264.AAC252C694C_3-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-Arigatou.Lucky.Star.Ep18.x264.AAC252C694C_3.jpg)  
  
And showed us the getabako room. The students in the school were dressed in coats over white shirts and black slacks, and the girls were coats over white shorts with black skirts and black socks. They were nice enough to wave and smile.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0506-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0506.jpg)  
  
Just opposite the school was its carpark, and its volley ball club bus. Ironically its mascot is a bunny too.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0520-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0520.jpg)  
  
The carpark was surrounded by grass fields on three sides. This was when I saw Konata walking around the area and realized something...  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-Arigatou.Lucky.Star.Ep18.x264.AAC252C694C_0-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-Arigatou.Lucky.Star.Ep18.x264.AAC252C694C_0.jpg)  
  
Of course, we can always ignore the subtle changes in scenery in the art.

After admiring the school for a while we then went for some ramen.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0571-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/12/wpid-sml_DSC_0571.jpg)  
  
The inside of the ramen stall

I got some shio ramen, and Miyuki approved. Since I'm tired from looting Akihabara tonight, the next post will be about the journey to the shrine itself!
