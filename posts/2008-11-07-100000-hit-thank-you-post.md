Thank you minna-san for visiting my blog! And for those of you who commented on my "articles" HONTOUNI ARIGATOU (meaning: Thank you very much, for those of you not so inclined). This blog has been going for a year and 9 months now, and there were times when I tried to start something (lucky star comics) but never really continued it, and sometimes, my post count just went down to 0 for a whole month, but I've never for once decided to forsake my blog! From now on a DAILY EPIC POST IS THE TARGET. YES, THE FORCE IS WITH THE BLOG, MAY THE BLOG CARRY ME IN ALL CHALLENGES! Okay, enough lame talk. Alright, since so many people have visited my blog, I'm sure everyone wants to know who else has come here too, and what they use, so let's look at some of the statistics collected since the dawn of my site.  
  
<!--more-->  
  
Until today, M$'s Internet Explorer has mainly dominated all the browsers that visit this page. However, due to the rapid adoption of Mozilla FireFox, it has been catching up lately to the numbers we have now.  
  
Internet Explorer **47.5%**  
Mozilla Firefox **42.4%**  
Safari **4.2%**  
Opera **2.6%**  
  
About half of the IE's that have visited my site are Internet Explorer 6. The other half is Internet Explorer 7. Half of the Firefox users are FireFox 3 users.  
  
I find it strange that still so few people use Opera. I believe it is possibly the single best browser on the web right now. Its memory footprint is small, and it is fast, and displays my web page optimally. Even the side panels on the right move smoothly! So, if you don't have it, go give it a go! I'm sure it'll become your default browser soon enough.  
  
On operating systems, we have the not-so-surprising dominance of Microsoft Windows. Which is sad, considering it is the least-inspired, and worst operating system of all of those in the list.  
  
Windows **90.3%**  
Mac OS **6.0%**  
Others **1.0%**  

  
- ![Ubuntu Linux](https://www.astrobunny.net/wp-content/plugins/firestats/img/browsers/ubuntu.png "Ubuntu Linux") Ubuntu Linux **0.4%**
  
- ![Linux](https://www.astrobunny.net/wp-content/plugins/firestats/img/browsers/linux.png "Linux") Linux **0.5%**
  
- ![Gentoo Linux](https://www.astrobunny.net/wp-content/plugins/firestats/img/browsers/gentoo.png "Gentoo Linux") Gentoo Linux **0.1%**
  
- ![SuSE Linux](https://www.astrobunny.net/wp-content/plugins/firestats/img/browsers/suse.png "SuSE Linux") SuSE Linux **0.0%**
  
- ![Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.astrobunny.net/wp-content/plugins/firestats/img/browsers/debian.png "Debian GNU/Linux") Debian GNU/Linux **0.0%**
  
- ![Fedora Linux](https://www.astrobunny.net/wp-content/plugins/firestats/img/browsers/fedora.png "Fedora Linux") Fedora Linux **0.0%**
  
  
Sad eh? However, the Mac OS share has been increasing lately. Possibly because of Macs becoming cheaper?  
  
Also, here's a time graph to show what time people usually come to my site. This is in New Zealand time, GMT+12.

As for countries, here's a big list of all the countries whose people have visited my blog and percentages of visits from each of the countries. It does seem that people from the United States really like my blog! Although, perhaps its just because they are the most connected people in the English-speaking world.

Once again, I'd like to thank everyone for visiting my blog! Being small and all I can't help but think this is just too good to be true.
