A while ago I finally managed to get my hands on Hatsune Miku, thanks to Max Factory actually going on and producing it for the 3rd time. For those of you who missed out on getting this figma (which I was in grave danger of) I guess its eBay for you.

Like countless other figmas, Miku comes with the ability to change faces, and the flap shows you how to do it. It even comes with a friendly warning to watch out for the microphone on Miku's headphones. do make sure you are careful when you change her face.

Like other figmas too, Miku comes carefully packaged between two pieces of plastic. Her body is littered with pieces of plastic carefully placed to separate painted parts from each other to prevent them from rubbing each other during shipping. I usually keep these pieces of plastic since they are invaluable towards preserving the figma when I move.

Like all other figmas, Miku also comes with a set of accessories. Though it isn't much, I think that its better than nothing. The accessories that come with Miku could not be more appropriate. Yes. I'm talking about the spring onions. Miku comes with two of them, which is awesome for reenacting those memes from nico nico and youtube. She also comes with that microphone stand and a microphone. (I'ma use them soon woot)

And without further ado, here's the figma in all her glory.

Though she doesn't look as good on the box of Yamaha's Vocaloid 2 packaging, the figma was actually made to be pretty cute.

Her zettais are exquisite.

If you click on the photo, you'll get an enlarged photo. Observe the carefully painted marks on the sleeve. I'm not sure I could do that. I'm sure they used some kind of stick and print technique to put that on the sleeve.

As with everything Miku, she MUST come with spring onions. It's like having Miso and Spring Onions. They MUST go together.

I'll leave it to you to imagine the bright stage lights behind her.

Anyway, a video that illustrates her freedom of movement was in the works, but since the Flash IDE is a piece of crap, its probably gonna come a bit later. Look forward to it though!
