After  
  
Unlike some people who say "chocolate Azusa is fine too". I disagree. I feel that chocolate Azusa is EPIC WIN. Her chocolateness led me to several Azugasms over the course of the B-side of the episode. Let's just hope Azusa remains low on luminosity and high on hue in subsequent episodes!!

Some might say Azusa has awakened the dormant dark-skin fetish that has been sleeping within me.
