Recently I obtained a new device for taking screencaps from real life. Thing is, I really don't know which is better? The old Kodak digital camera with the 3.5mm lens, or the new Nikon with a Nikkor 18-55mm?

Well, enough comparisons, lets see how well it does with the others.

Okay. My photography skillz suck. Most of you are probably thinking that that lens has just been wasted on a pro noob like me. Of course, the incredible number of options and settings just overwhelmed me, and the pictures that came out were so sharp it showed me things I've never noticed before, (see Tsukasa close up) and after a bit of snapping, all I wanted to do was to tidy my room.
