I want to thank everyone who made my birthday special on Sunday, especially Tabletier, Noobicity, NOBODY, jaser, hwl82, Sly3r, ineser, mike and the water ballons!! They really made my day haha. "Thanks I've recieved your wishes" also go to nicole, -k-, alvin, gordon, and everyone who sent me mail and MSN messages!<!--more-->  
  
Just yesterday I realized &nbsp;how unfit I was when I was trying to scram from the onslaught of the water balloons secretly prepared for me over the week by hwl. Damn I was surprised. Kudos goes to the genius who managed to hide them from my blind eyes in his room.  
  
I've also finished with the the Negima!? Episode 19 translations after a struggle to get some done as soon as the party was finished. &nbsp;It was random. That's all I'll tell for now until Mahora releases it! So be sure to tune in! Anyway, Its time to go off and get more homework done! See ya guys! Happy Mothers' Day!
