Finally got my copy of Lucky Star Re-Mix 002. This new remix album has turned out to be much better than the previous Lucky Star remix. It even features a group medley AND nice album art, which by the way, really compliments the better mixes. The only song I took with me from the last remix album was Motteke! Sailor Fuku [Metabo Taisaku Mix], and admittedly the only good one. This album however, was chock full of surprises. The only song that was not worth listening to being the first track: JAM ga Mottetta! Sailor Fuku, which I found to be a pretty annoying mix of otaku wannabe boys trying to sing Motteke Sailor Fuku with passion and flare and lots of unoriginal vocal editing.  
  
Here's my two cents of the tracks in the album:  
  
1. JAM ga Mottetta! Sailor Fuku  
Crap. Boys singing Motteke! Sailor Fuku in the place of the Lucky Star girls. It feels and sounds stupid and annoying.  
  
2. Motteke! Sailor Fuku EX.Motte[k]remix  
Hi-fi trance (not progressive at all) which is kinda annoying at first but grows on you. I got this one playing in my car, so I think I'm hooked already. Very annoying if you don't like constant highspeed bleeping and sawtooth action. Good for parties.  
  
3. Motteke! Knee Socks  
Nice original remix with some pretty cool surprises thrown in in terms of beat and some nice familiar melody from Kaeshite! Knee Socks. This one really caught my ear. Playing in the car too so you know I like it.  
  
4. Motteke! Sailor Fuku Electro Otome Chikku mix  
Slightly retro 90's style electronica with some pop style music lots of voice synth. This is doesn't have the steady techno beat but I love its bluey piano playing mixed in along with its wonderful stop-and-hop bridges.  
  
5. Motteke! Sailor Fuku Bak-Bak-Bakoon! Mix  
Oh man this must the best mix of random voice clips by the Lucky Star characters ever. More blues style stuff and a bit of R&B thrown in as well as Tsukasa's Character Album's Good Night loop put to damned good use. Nice background upbeat cafe music.  
  
6. Kumikyoku "Lucky Star Douga"  
The ultimate weapon! Modelled after Nico Nico Douga's Kumikyoku (Group Song) and even with the same types of drops in pace and wonderful rendition of the all-too-familiar Kogepan theme played with synth piano immediately after the Motteke! Sailor Fuku chorus in the beginning. Awesome stuff as soon as the drums roll in. The first time I heard this, was probably the best time in my life as far as I can remember from my short memory. Some of the songs are really good techno clips, while others plain silly but familiar and cozy "wawawawasuremono" and some from Akira too. Definitely a must listen.
