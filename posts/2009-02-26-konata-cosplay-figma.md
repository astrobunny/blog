Okay, so a short while ago I managed to get my hands on a Wonderfest Exclusive figma EX001 Konata Cosplay figma. I was pretty late to the game so I had to pay a small premium on top of the figure.But it was worth it.

First let me tell you about the e-bay seller who was real nice and sent me the figma the moment I paid for it. He put these cute stamps on the box.  
  
Awesome eh? Maybe I should do a stamp collection sometime.

So I'll break with tradition this time and skip on the package review and go straight to the meat. The primary reasons are:  
1) I have no time tonight, since the work that earns me the money to buy all this is getting heavier  
2) Some of my readers have said boring package review is boring.  
3) The package doesn't have much anyway. The only value in this figma is that it is an exclusive, and only a limited number has been made. I don't know the details though.

Ok. So lets get on to the meat. The figma comes with Konata cosplaying as Haruhi, an extra face, 6 extra hands and the figma stand. Quite lacking for a figma I must say.

It does come with quite a big picture of Tokyo Big Sight though. Not that its of much use to me.

The figma itself however, is as expected from the figma line. Bright and lively colours and the recognizable expression of Konata imitating Haruhi's serious don't cross me face.

Like all other figmas before it, it has its imperfections, caused by the plastic moulding and stuff. If you are a savvy craftsman, you should be able to file off the cuts and repaint the figma with no problem.

One of the things that bewildered me when I first had a good look at the figma is that I could not find the hole in which the stand arm fits into. I looked under the flap (not the skirt, though that couldn't be helped either) expecting to see a hole under the flap like Shana's and found no hole.

Shortly after almost giving up on wanting to use the stand, I noticed the hole in her hair. The previous figmas usually had a strand of hair to cover this but this figma just had one hole in the hair for the stand, and nothing else. Not even a strand of hair to cover it.

Haruhi and Konata together

I can so feel the Aya Hiranoness in her.

Obey, or risk doom.

Okay, for those of you who THINK that the parts in the Konata cosplay figma are reused from Haruhi, let's put them side by side and find out whether this is true. You might not be able to draw a good enough conclusion from this picture, so lets look closer.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4274-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4274.jpg)  
  
Here's a picture of their legs side by side. Definitely not the same. Konata's is shorter. Even the shoes are different.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4275-500x375.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/02/wpid-100-4275.jpg)  
  
I need not mention the hands. The difference in style here is pretty clear. Also, the scales are completely different. Konata has quite a larger ratio than Haruhi. Besides, she does not have breasts, and Haruhi does. Her cosplay costume is also a bit darker than Haruhi's original, and Konata's ribbon is shorter than Haruhi's. So there's no more argument now that the figma brand continues to live up to expectations of no spared effort.

And now for a little view of my shelf situation. It seems I am close (if not already) to running out of room for my figmas. This is news for me, since it would mean a new cabinet. Perhaps I should start considering buying a house...
