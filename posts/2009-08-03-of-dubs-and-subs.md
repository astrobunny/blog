Here's a little exercise in thought: What if you did watch an anime show that actually had decent dubs?

If you guys don't really remember dubs or think they are fine, here's an episode of Lucky Star starring Corenartar, Cargameen and Tsuecarser. I personally haven't seen any good dubs of anime yet. Simply none. On the bright side however, I find that dubs in general have the ability to turn a show of any genre into a comedy.  
  
With reference to the posted video I was cringing with embarrassment when Konata went "You-chan" or "Youey nay-sun" and Yutaka going "Corenater nay-chan's house". The effect of the usage of Japanese honorifics in actual spoken English exceeded my tolerance for ridicule, and I didn't know if I was supposed to be laughing or crying.  
  
As with everything else that is wrong and abominable, there will surely be people who see beauty in them. Of course, my mind is open to perspective. If you find that there are dubs that are actually a notch above the rest and do not sound like a bunch of adolescent teens still struggling to rid themselves of nursery rhymes, I would love to see it.  
  
Granted, I might be slightly biased because I have grown up watching Garfield and Power Rangers in English, I feel that cartoon shows should be voiced in the same language as the culture they were created in. It leaves me wondering why American licensors continue to bother with English dubs for anime shows, despite the fact that subs are so much easier to create, and they promote literacy.
