I wonder if its me, or if its just that my days are just too short. Or whether or not I should take a break from coding for my project... Ah well, at least I have done quite a bit. Time to work on stuff I always wanted to. Back to translating and hopefully getting another episode done today.<!--more-->  
  
Recently, I've been thinking of how I am going to implement the Negima!? game that me and Erik have been thinking of doing. I've just finished the title screen, but that's about it. We need a proper story and arc to do it. It seems however, that the possibilities are endless. I just collected a bunch of sprites to kickstart the design with, although there still are the terrain sprites to do. Oh well, I think a meeting will solve a lot of these problems.  
  
Ahh&nbsp;yess,&nbsp;back&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;old&nbsp;School&nbsp;Rumble.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;my&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;of&nbsp;their&nbsp;EDs.
