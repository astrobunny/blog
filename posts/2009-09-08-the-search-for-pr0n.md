Kanbaru has my respect. Not only does she have the guts to pull out intestines and shit, she also goes into boys rooms looking for their secret items/loot.

Of course, boys are the most predictable organizers in the world, since they don't have much stuff usually and most stuff lies around. If it isn't lying around, it means they don't want you seeing it.

But Kanbaru, being a girl and all is oblivious and believes that boys are simply as organized as every other girl.

How naive.

If a girl comes into your room and starts searching for your happy material, what would you do?
