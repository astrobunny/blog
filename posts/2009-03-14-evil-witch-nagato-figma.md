After long lengths of procrastination, I have finally decided to open my Evil Witch Nagato Figma. I know I am HORRIBLY late on this, but what's a man to do? This package has proven itself to be one of the most interesting and most fun figma sets I have ever acquired. For one thing, it is PACKED with all manner of accessories, something relatively rare among the figma series.

On the outset, the package does not seem like much but a standard amount of stuff that always comes with all figmas. The figma has been packaged with the same kind of care you'd expect from most other products from the series, with nice little pull-off plastic pieces that protect the paint.

Here's all the accessories laid out. If you actually look at it, it is a LOT of stuff! There are 12 extra hands that come with the figma, which I haven't seen yet in any other figma. Apart from that, Evil Witch Nagato comes with her witch cloack that she used during the concert, the guitar, a tray with 2 cups and a kettle, Shamisen, Kyon's cat, and 2 magic wands. I'm not sure why there were 2, but I'm sure spares are always good.

Look at Shamisen, he's so cute and sleeping so soundly. Now all we need is Kyon's sister to feed it.

Another notable accessory is the guitar. Its made quite detailed, but not as detailed as I hoped it would be. But then again, this is an action figure, and I play with my action figures, so I ain't complaining if they didn't make something easy to ruin.

The guitar comes with a strap too. How nice.

Here's Nagato with her guitar. You probably have no idea how much time and effort it took to make her look like this. For one thing, her left hand doesn't fit into the socket properly. I need to find a way around that, so the hand pops out everytime I try to adjust the guitar. Unfortunately the guitar moves away when I try to insert the hand, and the arm goes into the coat when I try to push the hand into the arm, so I used a pen knife to block the arm from going in.   
  
Also, the body doesn't go up high enough for you to insert the head. You need to have half the coat off first to enable yourself to hold the body to insert the head. Which means it makes it difficult to make the other half of the coat connect once the head is in since the buttons aren't easy to align. There's gotta be a better way to do this.

Overall however, the work was worth it. Nagato looks very nice and very cool with her guitar and pick in her hand. I like her better without the hat. I'm not sure about everyone else though but she looks like a rockstar to me.

She looks so innocent yet so composed and so poised to start jamming. I must admit after playing with Nagato for a while I really felt like getting an electric guitar.

Because it took so much effort just to get her in this state, I might leave her like this for quite a while before I figure out how to insert her guitar playing left hand in the correct way.

Bottom up view shows how cute and lovable Nagato is with her little head stickingout of the massive hat above her. If you haven't witnessed Nagato's guitar playing prowess, I must suggest you watch the Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi. Watch all of it or it will not have any impact on you. And you will see what's so great about her. If you already watched it and want to re-live the excitement and pure passion of the moment when Haruhi sang God Knows, Here's the Youtube.

The 2 minutes of pure excitement and musical gratification was simply the most unforgettable experience of mine when watching Haruhi.

Overall, very wonderful figure. She is so photogenic my camera was trying to woo her with its ultrabright flash. Little did it know Nagato can perform an SQL query and change the speed of light.

What do you guys think about her compared to the normal literature club Nagato?
