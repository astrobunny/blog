Kagami and Tsukasa decided to put a little show on for me today. They must've been practicing hard, since sometimes when I catch Kagami jumping around she'd like go "I'm not doing anything!" and storm off angrily. But I didn't know what that was all about anyway so I just shrugged. It turns out it was this.

I wasn't able to record it since they didn't let me, but [oOga](http://www.thebanzaieffect.com/) found something pretty close. Enjoy. Thanks oOga!
