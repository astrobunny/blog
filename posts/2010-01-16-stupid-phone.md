Ok so today I suddenly acquired something I never thought I would actually get. It was actually because my last phone died a painful and horrible death. Kagami was pretty excited about my new keitai for some reason. I thought Japanese people weren't impressed by the iPhone?

Kagami then figured everything out about the phone in minutes. But I wanted to put my techno and awesome pictures in there, along with some apps so I decided to hook it up to my computer.

So it started installing...

and then failed.

I decided it wasn't worth my time. I'll get a new phone later.

Since playing with Kagami is far more fun. TICKLE TICKLE TICKLE
