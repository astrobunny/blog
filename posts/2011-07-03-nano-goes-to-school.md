I've never seen a girl so happy to go to school before. Its amazing how similar she looks to a person who got his first job. I'M FINALLY NORMAL!<!--more--> [![](wp-uploads/2011/07/wpid-HorribleSubs-Nichijou-14-720p_1-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2011/07/wpid-HorribleSubs-Nichijou-14-720p_1.jpg)  
  
She's even got all the tools sorted, and was excitedly making a checklist like someone going on a dream cruise. Normality rules again.

And then theres the snickers commercial joke.

But when she discovers school goes all day, she proceeds to Nano's her hand. Literally.

It's not everyday you see a schoolgirl with a winding key on her back running to school eagerly. So normal.

Or a robot transferring in from no-school.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2011/07/wpid-HorribleSubs-Nichijou-14-720p_8-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2011/07/wpid-HorribleSubs-Nichijou-14-720p_8.jpg)  
  
Of course, everyone can't help but notice how normal it is.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2011/07/wpid-HorribleSubs-Nichijou-14-720p_10-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2011/07/wpid-HorribleSubs-Nichijou-14-720p_10.jpg)  
  
and then theres the teacher who can't normally seem to get her questions through.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2011/07/wpid-HorribleSubs-Nichijou-14-720p_11-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2011/07/wpid-HorribleSubs-Nichijou-14-720p_11.jpg)  
  
Yukko was also abnormally observant today.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2011/07/wpid-HorribleSubs-Nichijou-14-720p_12-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2011/07/wpid-HorribleSubs-Nichijou-14-720p_12.jpg)  
  
And then the jokes degraded into a yakisoba/yakisaba fight between Yukko and Mio because Yukko heard Mio say yakisaba when she asked for yakisoba.

I guess Mio's epic faces are something you'd normally expect by now.
