Not too long ago I brought Kagami around the mountains to see what a port at Christchurch looked like. But I dropped her from pretty high up and one of her tails broke off. She was quiet for the rest of the day. This is the second time [I broke Kagami](http://www.astrobunny.net/2009/07/24/ressurrecting-kagamin/). I think I jinxed myself after [reading a horror story again](http://www.astrobunny.net/2009/03/23/horror-stories-are-unlucky/).

The shaft seemed to be chipped off all the way into the tail. This was similar to what happened to a [other blogger](http://thetsundere.wordpress.com/2009/08/19/repairing-figma-kagami/) who had a bit of trouble with the fragility of figmas too.

I was pretty fortunate that most of the shaft was still sticking out of her head. This meant that with a strong enough glue I could make it connect back to the tail again.

So I ran around the nearby shops to see if there were any places selling super glue.

Most of the shops however, were food shops...

There was even this Zebar.

Nope. No super glue here either.

In the end I found a little supermarket where I bought this gorilla glue. It was such a good glue it was scary. I dripped a bit on my hands and it immediately form a shiny plate that I couldn't scratch off. It's still on my finger.

After I used a drop to glue the two parts together, the tail was immediately stuck back, and was as strong as ever.
