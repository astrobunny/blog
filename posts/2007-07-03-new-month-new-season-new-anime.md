Zero no Tsukaima Futadzuki no Kishi (Riders of the Twin Moons)  
  
OMG! It's a season 2 of Zero no Tsukaima! The timing couldn't be better. I just finished watching the first season and now the second one comes out. God must love me. I heard that this season of Zero no Tsukaima would be done by a different, and arguable better director. Who knows, it might just turn out to be a very good 12 episodes, unlike the last season whose last episode almost made me cry as a result of a rushed ending and a very very badly modified story. The story has got to hold the kisses off to the last moment to be really nice to watch but nuuuuuuuu... they had to make it quick. Ugh. oh well enough of my ranting about the past season. I'm sure looking forward to this one. They had better not disappoint me.  
  
Sky Girls

Apparently and obviously a new one. Well, not really. It had an OVA come out sometime ago. Looks to me like some Xenoglossia-like anime with cute girls giving us lots of Moe to enjoy and then some action to top it off as entertainment. 26 Episodes lined up! How nice, looks like I'm going to have something to watch over the will-be-stress-filled third term of uni. I think I'll go get the OVA first before deciding on banging all the bandwidth into the floor for this.  
  
School Days

Ah an anime based off a violent animated game. I wonder how this will turn out... Jigoku shoujo style? Or Shuffle style? Apparently its about this girl who tries to get a boy closer to another girl, but wants a kiss in return. LOL. Talk about trying to build your own love triangle. DIY ftw. People say it might not be so good coz of a director who does sucky anime series. But I think I'll still give it a try. Since Mahora is gonna be involved in subbing it.  
  
Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei  
 ![SZS](http://gallery.astrobunny.net/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=733&g2_serialNumber=1)  
Looks like another one of those Negima-style cartoons where the main character is a boy and there are lots of girls and magic involved. Oh. It's not an underaged boy anymore, maybe. But anime is hard to predict in certain ways so I'll give it the benefit of a doubt. Looks interesting since the director is the director of Negima!? Which I am really really fond of for its artwork. Must have a look! SHAFT ftw.  
  
Nanatsuiro Drops

Moe moe moe... that's all anime nowadays is all about. Its all about cute and lovely and more cute \<3. This one is about magical girls again. From what I heard so far, its a love-hate relationship for people who have just started watching it. It's on its way to my place now so I might just write something about it later. But from what I heard, its got what everyone wants to see. Cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cute .  
  
Moetan

Moar moe. I almost mistook the promotional picture for Nanoha LoliS 4th season. Only to be disappointed and in some ways happy to find another magical girl story coming out. Hashihime says it airs after 1 a.m. So its probably not for kids? It's cute though. And All I can find on google an incredible collection of cute pictures. The best that Japan can offer in terms of cuteness? We'll find out. Reminds me of popotan.  
  
Doujin Work  
 ![Doujin work](http://gallery.astrobunny.net/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=724&g2_serialNumber=1)  
This I GOTTA see. I thought it was just a collection of doujin work by doujin artists around the area. But it turns out that it's actually the story of a doujin artist! Now, that was what caught my attention. The drawings look good; ala Azumanga Daioh. But maybe that's because its based off 4koma. Japan is really mass-producing this stuff. I can't even watch like 1% of them with my current schedule. To think, they release 1000's of frames daily from those hot sweaty drawing offices. Oh well, if it's to keep the world entertained, I hope they don't stop. And I hope the doujin artists never stop as well! Coz they are the ones who continue the universe started by the official animators. Besides. If they did, the doujin work would lose its taste.  
  
But I really gotta go have a look at Higurashi. Looks like I'm missing out on something.
