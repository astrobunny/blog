Haruhi saw a monster drop a big box of loot in my room today while I was at work, so she decided to drag Kyon along to help her with it.

It might not look like it but getting from the shelf to the floor is quite a long way for the figmas to walk, with my elaborately built maze of cardboard sheets and keyboards to act as cushons and climbing surfaces.

Oh Tsuruya and Ryoko have already arrive at the box. I wonder what Tsuruya is doing with those pom poms.

While Haruhi was cutting, Tsuruya decided to tease Kyon.

Haruhi wasn't herself today. She was working hard all by herself opening the box while the rest were enjoying themselves.

Oh ow. Looks like Haruhi noticed Kyon is slacking.

Ah. She's back to her bossy self again. Yokatta. Kyon's got it tough having her around.

Small loot this month. Saving for a certain trip to a certain place.

Tsukasa gets new clothes.

So does Kagami.

And Miyuki

We have two robots joining us too. Aegis

And Drossel. Now all I have to do is complete the cowload of sidequests that have time limits right now in real life so I can get on and actually spend some good quality time with my loot like I havent done in ages.
