Today, I got home and saw the two of them fighting. I only managed to get the camera out at the last few seconds since Shana was slashing away at everything while Yuki was dodging, her katana almost cut me. I only managed some pictures after Shana's katana broke at the hands of Yuki. She went berserk after that. Here goes!

Haruhi: THAT WAS TOO STIFF! SHANA! POINT THE KATANA AT HER! NOT AT THE SKY!  
  
Oh. Its just Haruhi trying to make another show.  
  
Ok. Actually, the Katana really did break. its now under a serious gluing process which will take a few days to restore its original beauty and strength. But for now, we'll have to do with unarmed combat.
