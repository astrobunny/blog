Lately I've been having too much fun with the latest Korean game thing in strategy games. Yes, that's right. If you couldn't guess it you probably have been living under a rock, or real life has taken your life away from you.

Interestingly enough, the gameplay is almost identical, unlike a lot of other strategy games which constantly try to change the user interface, most of the stuff in StarCraft 2 remains identical to what it was in StarCraft, which was a welcome change from the usual practice. Ironically.

The game is a lot of fun to play too, allowing you lots of choices ranging from early game cheese or standard large army and economy play and big fights all over the map, and the computer is predictable enough to stomp on as a form of relaxation.

But me and a friend were bored during one of our AI stomps so we decided to have a bit of fun drawing on the map. For those of you too lazy to click the above picture to see the minimap, here it is magnified below:
