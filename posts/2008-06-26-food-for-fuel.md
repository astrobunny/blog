Recently there has been a rising trend in fuel prices as those bastards selling oil continue to jack up prices to fill up their own pockets and leave billions of people with less and less money to buy fuel with. With these trends comes the rise of food prices too. But the rise in food prices aren't because of the increased transportation fees associated with fuel. There are now more people than ever but still roughly the same number of farms around the world that actually feed humans. The result? Not as many carrots as we once had.  
  
You might think that with so much land on earth, how can there not be enough? Well, most of the farms are used to feed livestock that grows our cattle, sheep and chicken that supply our neverending appetite for McDonalds, steak and KFC. In a way they are feeding us, in a way they aren't. But that's not the biggest reason. The reason food is starting to get scarce is, in an effort to make more money out of their farms, farmers are now moving out to planting sugar to produce alcohol. For what? You guessed it, fuel. With fuel prices rising like temperatures inside a tsundere on a bad day, farmers are finding it more profitable to just plant oil instead of food.The direct consequence: less food for more people.  
  
I was a bit outraged when I read this in the news, and a quick google will lead you to lots of places talking about farmers moving from food to fuel, but very few that actually condemn them, playing down how bad this situation is becoming. Of course, this is the [Malthusan Catastrophe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_catastrophe) in the making. It was and still is very obvious that we are headed the way of having too many people and not enough food in this world. Yet, no one really says anything about it. People just shrug it off and change the subject, or quote advancements in agricultural and genetic technology.  
  
Farms are currently harvested 4 times a year in some places and what, are they gonna genetically engineer people that eat less? The r [ecent summit by world leaders with oil producing countries](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/23/2282226.htm?section=justin) just show that people simply aren't or just not wanting to pay attention to people going hungry. The [food summit at Rome](http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/rome-s-food-summit-a-test-passed-a-baton-passed) just threw blame at other people. Are people too afraid to face a fact that is currently slapped in their faces? Or are humans just programmed to create their own doom?  
  
Maybe someday gems won't be the only things that will be measured in carats(carrots).
