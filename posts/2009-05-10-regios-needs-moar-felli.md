Felli was given almost ZERO air time this episode. Did the artists lose control of their hands or something? An episode without Felli is an episode FAILED. Thankfully however, this episode does not fail because it still has Felli. But it is very close to being FAIL in my books.

And Felli looks good as ever even inside a helmet. Gosh I would like to see her hair flowing out of the helmet when she takes it off.

... And what the hell is up with the Engrish scenes anyway!? All that time is better off being spent giving FELLI air time.
