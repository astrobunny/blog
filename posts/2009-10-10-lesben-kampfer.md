Okay, so Sakura falls in love with this blue haired girl who saves her multiple times. But in reality this girl is really a boy, but this girl isn't a trap, he just transforms into a she, so Sakura fell in love with a real girl, so Sakura is a lesbian. Natsuru thinks its weird but... when he transforms into a girl, but since he's got a guy's mind he still likes girls does that mean he also becomes a lesbian when he turns into a girl?

Sakura's cute and all, but I don't see her being hot enough to be an idol or anything. It was probably just made up to make a story. But then again, if you were a boy thinking Sakura is awesome and realizing she's lesbian, then you would probably feel pretty disappointed.

Then again, if you could transform into a girl, would you like the girl that loves the girl you instead of the boy you who loves the girl who loves the girl you as a girl, who's hoping to have a normal boy girl relationship but that wouldn't work because the girl wants a girl girl relationship with the girl you?

I guess even this is too much for me, the audience to handle. I get all fired up and stuff when I think about it. But the prospect of even becoming a girl is too much for me. What if I forget to change and wake up in the morning in the wrong gender during the wrong time of the month?

I'd probably dance around trying to convince people nothing has happened when in fact I really have a problem with being myself.

On the other hand, its amazing how Natsuru got used to being a she so quickly. It must be pretty easy to be a girl. Well, I guess he needed to get used to the extra baggage on her chest and the weaker legs quickly since he was going to be a victim of genderbending at the worst possible times.

I must say however, Natsuru does look pretty damn cool and pretty damn hot because of her height, which she retains after transforming. Now I know why models must be tall.
