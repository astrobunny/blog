We met and you were the worst fool  
My anger for you will never cool  
I could just drown you in a pool  
But you are more useful as a mule.  
  
And sometimes I wish I never found  
you for your foolishness is too profound  
I can't stand how my heart pounds  
at the sight of you and at your sounds  
  
... still if the sky comes down on you  
I'll make sure that your dream comes true  
For once I have something to keep too  
to love, protect and to help you through  
  
Thanks Suicider, for the amazing pic!
