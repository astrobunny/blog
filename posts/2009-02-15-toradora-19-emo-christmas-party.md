I must say that Toradora has been full of surprises lately. First with Minorin's crazy randomness, and then her transformation into a very very emo and sad girl, and then Aisaka's sudden transformation into a good girl. And now a christmas party at the school continues to entertain us with new plot twists and surprises.

Surprise No. 1: Taiga gave Ryuuji her dad's suit. Ok that isn't a surprise, but seeing this:

Threw me off quite a bit. I never knew Taiga could look so... Tame.

Surprise No 2: Kitamura is an exhibitionist. Although purely for comedy and regular WTF, it was interesting to note that Taiga did not go all dere dere and red-faced after seeing this. Very interesting indeed.

Surprise No. 3: Baka-chi and Taiga singing together on stage. I was quite surprised at this, and everyone else probably too. The singing was really good! And besides that, the fact that they actually got along and practiced to sing a song for everyone! The story never gave any indication whatsoever that they'd actually be close enough to actually do this! Well, I could be wrong you know.

Surprise No. 4: Actually this isn't really a surprise. But its the first time Taiga gave any indication that she is in fact, currently infatuated with Ryuuji. Nothing much can be said about this at the moment, but I'm sure its a great place for some really awesome development to start.

Surprise No. 5: This scene is probably the only one I would remember for the rest of my life from the series. Minorin, in all her cheerful wonder, would never have given anyone any clue that she could also be this sad. She looks as if she got raped by the Christmas Ghost of Sadness or something. One thing to note however, is that in the next episode preview, Minorin seemed to have hard resetted her personality. I don't know abuot you but I don't think it bodes well for the plot to have her suddenly become cheerful for no reason at all. At least give us some backstory, silly narrators!!!

Anyway, this episode's christmas theme came a bit late. I wished it really had come during christmas. That way we can all enjoy our ronery nights listening to Holy Night. Anyway, I've included some awesome screenies for a memorable episode. Enjoy.
