Cecily Campbell seems to be very determined to be a knight. What amazes me is that people actually let her be a knight. I would've thought that once you gain knighthood you'd have the courage and ability to do your job at least fairly competently.

Though it seems being a knight isn't the only thing she hasn't managed to do properly yet.

Man, if this story were authentic and true, medevial people must have had it good. Though these days, most of us would probably find it difficult to imagine life other than what we experience nowadays.
