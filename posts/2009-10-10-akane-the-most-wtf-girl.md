We all know Akane enjoyed this.

What I find funny about Akane is that she is ALWAYS blushing. God knows what goes through her head all the time.

I mean, getting invited to a boy's house when his parents aren't around isn't like a big deal or anything, I mean he just wants someone to talk to.

Though I must admit Natsuru's joke about no one being able to hear her scream is a little bit on the bad side.

Then again, it seems she overreacts to almost everything Natsuru does.

I've never seen a girl so willing to jump on a boy's bed the first time they are in his house.

She must be misunderstanding something.

My favorite part is when she was all dai shokku when he started talking about Sakura.

"DON'T PULL DOWN HER SKIRT! WHAT IF SHE LIKES IT?"  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-gg_Kampfer_-_02_D1A544A6_15-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-gg_Kampfer_-_02_D1A544A6_15.jpg)  
  
"You like it when people rip your skirt off?"  
"Depends on the person..."  
Priceless...

I get the feeling that whoever wins this Kampfer Kampf will get to be Sakura's bride or something along those lines.

Even more interesting is why Akane haets Sakura so much. The deredere Akane is like all tsun when Natsuru talks about Sakura, and the vulgar Akane turns into a monster when it comes to Sakura.

I'll kill you!

Despite Natsuru being such an immense hottiem I still prefer Akane.
