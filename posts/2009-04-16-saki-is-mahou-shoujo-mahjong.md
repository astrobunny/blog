Something about anime is that they can completely turn something usually mundane and unexciting to the observer into a dramatic and magical symphony of light. Even if its just a table game of picking a tile up and putting another back on the table. Though it would be nice so long games would actually be interesting with a bit of lightning exchange and sky battles.

I don't know about you but being beaten beautifully by a master mahjong player doesn't really give that mahjong player wings that make her seem to be flying further and further out of reach for me. Though, maybe it would be the case if the player that was handing my ass to me was a busty schoolgirl in a sailor uniform, maybe she would form bright yellow wings...

Man, when I saw this scene, there was this adrenaline rush that came over me and put me in a trance, trying to tell me that if I was about to score massive in a game of mahjong, the tile would glow in my hand and light up the entire room, warning everyone to stop playing with me before they lose all their money. When I came to, I realized I was watching anime, and not actually playing a real game with real tiles. Though, it would still be nice to have glowing tiles someday. I wonder if they sell such things.

AND NOW, FOR THE MOMENT OF TRUTH!

Man, from now on, I am so slamming the majanpai on the table hard enough to make little fragments shatter and scatter around it.

Not to mention the way Saki exposes her Kan is WAY COOL. I would never have thought of exposing two tiles of the four like this! Someone get Saki a Striker Witch Unit! RINSHAN TSUMO DIVINE BUSTAAA!   
  
/me goes to buy a Japanese Mahjong set.
