Kagami: Ahhh... summer is great. The wind is warm, the sun shines all day and you don't have to hug at your scarf and breathe like a dragon.

Kagami: Come to think of it what were you doing with Konata most of the time in the TV room?  
Tsukasa: Oh, we watched lots of these awesome documentaries about the universe and stuff!

Tsukasa: There was this one where they explained how our moon is really strange because it's so big, and how life would be so different without the moon. They said that there used to be two planets full of water in the solar system, they hit each other and became the Earth and the moon.  
Kagami: Woah. Interesting.

Tsukasa: Then there was this one explaining the dark matter in the universe and how 90% of the mass of the universe is unaccounted for. It was amazing that they were even able to come up with how heavy the universe is! And then they started explaining all this hard stuff about relativity and stuff.

Tsukasa: Then there was one about atoms and how the tiniest particles can actually travel through time, and another one about this large machine where you smash atoms together and one about this guy who was looking for a plane shot down in world war two.

Kagami: Hey that was a lot of stuff you watched. How many of those things did you guys actually watch?  
Tsukasa: I don't know, Konata had like this whole pile of DVDs...
