Seriously, Mr. President. Seriously. This isn't the West Virginia Primaries, nor is it a Korn concert. And it definitely isn't the stage of [insert Japanese idol who loves to speak engrish here] 's concert. I digress. I would love to see an American President do something like this. I could not have LOL'ed harder when I was looking at this. The feeling was an describable mix of amusement and embarrassment. I was half-expecting Miku and friends to jump out and start dancing.

CANAAN is an awesome show, and a great moe flick since I'm a big fan of DFC. However, despite all the points with action, DFC and plot it scores with me, I cannot get over the fact that the Chinese don't speak Chinese, Chinese songs have the moe squeak voice, the Chinese songs and idols don't fail with imitation heaven, songs in the show have no more than 5 words of lyrics and the Americans talk a bunch of guys which have had their tongue stapled. I am now convinced that Japanese dubs of English are worse than English dubs of Japanese. This might be something small and should be overlooked but it was completely blown out of proportion in this episode. I can no longer ignore it.

Though, I must say that despite almost completely failing with the incredible levels of annoying, the show's one saving grace is Liang Qi. That's right. I've completely fallen in love with her sadistic, explosive temperament and extremely short cheongsam. Keep her in the show and I will try my best to ignore the LOVE AND PEACE. Until then, GET SOME.
