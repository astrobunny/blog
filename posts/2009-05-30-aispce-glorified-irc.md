Yes. I started playing aiSp@ce. Since about a few months ago. The first thing I noticed within the first hour of playing this game is: This game is freakin pointless. Its pretty and all and it feels like you are in anime world and everyone around you speaks Japanese, but it ends there. You change your clothes to look like your favorite anime character or dress yourself up like a girl you fancy, and then just sit down and chat with everyone. Here I'm in CLANNAD island picking dangoes.

In aispace, the central meeting point for everyone is Akihabara. Yes. The Akihabara area is quite faithfully modelled after the real Japanese Akihabara, in all its noisy advertisement glory and otaku merchandise shops. The thing is about the faithfulness is that its just a small section of the main street and Akihabara bridge that is available in aispace. There's also a massive screen at the end of the street which plays random nico nico clips.

Lol Fail. You can usually find me at Akiba at around 10-12 noon GMT. The name's 綾波春香。 Don't ask.

You can do lots of funny things though, since its a 3D game, it comes with its variety of 3D bugs, like non-ideal collision detection and camera artifacts. One can exploit the camera's limits to look up the skirts of the girls in aispace. I'll leave the method of doing that as an exercise to the reader.

You can also set up little points with a message and sit around and let everyone gather around you. Well, its a game that is very centered around community anyway. There are no monsters to fight, no sceneries to behold. Just plain do this do that quests and lots of clothes to dress up in. You also get a room that you can decorate as much as you want. But you have to earn money to buy the TVs and beds you want to put in your room.
