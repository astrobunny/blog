I remembered when LCD color monitors started to be sold for desktop computers and not just for notebook computers, which were beginning to be much more mobile as LCDs were being used as their displays. I was born into an era where computing was already (inevitably) blazing down the path of dominance of everyone's lives. Despite LCDs still being far inferior to CRTs (yuck), and their refresh rates hideously slow, it did not take long for LCDs to improve from that monochrome display used by the the computer seen above (which was my first notebook computer btw), into low refresh rate low brightness versions of the wonderful displays we know today.

Fast forward to one week ago, Dell sent in one of their almost-phased out version of their 24" desktop LCDs, the 2407WFP. Despite being sold at clearance prices now, this panel still trumps many many other panels in terms of performance (6ms refresh), image quality (1:1000 contrast WOOT) and vividness (5% brightness lights the room up as well as the fluorescent lamp on the ceiling). The box came in such a wonderful, such conspicuous glamor that everyone in the house couldn't help but ask what it was (-\_-").

Opening the box was as gratifying an experience as walking into a room where thousands of minions are prepared to place a crown on your head, give you a globe and scepter and walk on their knees in the highest respects for their newfound leader. The package it came in was nothing short of complete. it even came with a massive manual that unfortunately, contained nothing I didn't know about this monitor already from the numerous praises reviews I read about it.

Of course, like a [Spinosaurus](http://www.livescience.com/animals/060301_big_carnivores.html) tearing away at an Argentinasaurus that it finally managed to fell after a 2-hour long struggle for lunch, I tore away at the plastics that were used to cover the various peripherals that were packaged with the monitor. Eagerly waiting to see what lay inside.

The compulsory how-to-install guide that came with my original 17" screens too

The USB hub cable, DVI cable and power cable

The monitor stand

Why the monitor comes with a VGA cable attached to it still eludes me.

This feels like lifting up the skirt of a girl to see the good stuff... This lady's got lots of holes. DVI, VGA,RCA video, S-Video and Component-Video

Yes. Very high resolution indeed. I wonder what the iPod-like trackwheel is for.

Now, the 24" sits beside its two 17" brothers.
