So I got one of these things to find out what all the hype was about it. After getting it I realized the box was a lot bigger than I thought, not to mention it looked a lot better than in the pictures I saw on the figma promotions.

It seems we are expected to cut off the flaps to use them as speech bubbles.

All the pieces are wrapped in a bubble wrap, which has a plastic bag inside it wrapping the collection of pieces in it.

Further more, each piece is wrapped in its own little plastic bag inside the outer plastic bag. Perhaps they overdid the wrapping thing?

Okay so I opened 2 of the boxes just to check out what the connectivity possiblities were.

First there was the sidecovers which you can attach to each side of the base. Each base has 4 side covers that come with it.

At first I thought it was meant to make the base look pretty until I discovered you can slide pieces of cardboard between the base and the side covers, to hold the cardboard in place to make a background.

Next is the base connector. It connects two bases together.

Feels like Lego eh?

You can even use it with an L adapter

And connect the both of them together at right angles.

It looked like I could do lots of stuff with this... till I realized the base is pretty small.

Kagami: I get the feeling they somehow managed to sell you something worthless.

She's not quite right tho. Thanks to the di:stage, now my figmas aren't afraid of dropping anymore from shakes to the cabinet. Also, I learned to implement something the Japanese are very good at, crowded living, since I have more Haruhi figmas than I have any use for.
