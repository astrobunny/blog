Oh noes bunny has a life! Is what probably some of you would say when I go on a blogopause for 2 days. Well, the last few nights were spent pretty much outside playing hard after a day of working hard. I re-introduced myself to rock climbing and had a nice big party with a bunch of Polish friends. Poles are fun people. I must say. Oh well, today I went for a hike with Haruhi, will post more pictures once I regain my energy. I am so worn out right now.
