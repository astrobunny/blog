On Thursday I returned to Singapore in transit back to New Zealand, and took some pictures of what I did there.

This is a picture of Marina Square, which me and a wolf walked past on the way to Marina Bay Sands  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0071-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0071.jpg)  
  
Since Marina Bay Sands opened that day, we decided to go up and visit the top.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0073-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0073.jpg)  
  
First we had to walk down a path that led to a lot of construction sites.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0086-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0086.jpg)  
  
And then walk under the immense building.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0098-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0098.jpg)  
  
After we got up, we then started to realize how high the buildings were.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0103-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0103.jpg)  
  
Kagami enjoyed herself. I just had a chance to face my fear of heights.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0107-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0107.jpg)  
  
And they seemed to be constructing a death star of some sort.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0133-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0133.jpg)  
  
Picture of the wolf and I.

Golf course on the other side of the bay

Motorways running over the water.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0147-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0147.jpg)  
  
Around Marina Barrage is also a site of intense construction.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0210-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0210.jpg)  
  
Meanwhile Kagami continued to enjoy the view from the top.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0224-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0224.jpg)  
  
As the sky grew darker, the city became lit as if stars fell out of the sky onto it.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0229-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0229.jpg)  
  
Watching pretty sunset. Everyone nowadays seems to own an SLR and tripod.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0241-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0241.jpg)  
  
A nice view of the very busy port of Singapore.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0247-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0247.jpg)  
  
The golf course is now lit with lights  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0264-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0264.jpg)  
  
The financial district is a wonderful sight  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0278-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0278.jpg)  
  
View of the Marina Bay area

More views of the city  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0281-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0281.jpg)  
  
A stadium being built for the youth olympics.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0298-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0298.jpg)  
  
It started raining after it became dark, so we went back into the hotel buildings  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0304-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0304.jpg)  
  
Inside the hotel buidling. You can see where each of the 3 towers rise from the main building  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_03431-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_03431.jpg)  
  
The helix bridge just outside the sands building

On the next day, we headed out to a karaoke box. Reimu decided to ride on the wolf's shoulder  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0367-8-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0367-8.jpg)  
  
On the way, I saw a colonial style hotel that looked really out of place among the boxes.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_03801-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_03801.jpg)  
  
There were nice fountains.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0386-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0386.jpg)

Kagami and Reimu had mock battles while we were singing in the K-box  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0417-55-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0417-55.jpg)  
  
They seemed to have learned that from Ip Man  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0424-60-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_0424-60.jpg)

We also met the plum, ume and sentinel011 from [The Bonkurasu Brigade.](http://bonkurasu.animeblogger.net/)  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_04331-500x752.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2010/06/wpid-sml_DSC_04331.jpg)

After the Karaoke, we all headed out to dinner

Which involved some very nice dishes. More on this later.
