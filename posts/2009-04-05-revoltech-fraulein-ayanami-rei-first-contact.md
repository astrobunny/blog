Lonely Rei seems to have lost her way and finds herself on the Mai Room HQ Command Center. She's probably thinking it rains in here too.

She looks lost.

Oh lookie. A wild Rin has appeared!

Rin says "Hello". Rin uses "WAVE"

Rin extends her hand!

The introverted Rei doesn't seem to understand the friendly gesture of greeting extended to her.

The moment of silence and awkwardness.

"Perhaps if I extend the same hand"

"No, no, you should give me your right hand too"

"What an interesting method of greeting"  
"Hi, I'm Rin"

"There. Now we're friends!"

"Friends... That sounds nice."

"Ah, hi, let me introduce him to y..."

"Threat identified. Possibly an angel-possesed mechanical unit. Please step back, Rin-san."

Rin: So what's your name anyway?  
Rei: Ayanami Rei.  
Rin: Ayanami-san, what a nice name! What was that big fork you had anyway?  
Rei: Lance of Longinus.  
Rin: Ah... Lance of Long...nose...?  
Rei: Why doesn't this mechanical android have a pilot?  
Rin: Eh? Oh... come to think of it...  
Saviour: o.O

Slow me managed to obtain a Revoltech Fraulein Ayanami Rei. This marks the beginning of Revoltech Fraulein line of action figures appearing in my collection. It turns out that Revoltech doesn't produce a lot of human action figures, but they do mostly robots, and they seem to be really popular in that field too. I also heard about the legendary Revoltech Joints, which turned out to be pretty nice since the figure felt more like an action figure with it. It also gave it more strength, and the parts don't simply shear when you push them too hard. They gracefully fall out of their joint socket, which is awesome, since this means that you can actually afford to be a little rougher with them and they still won't break.
