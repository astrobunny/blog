Lately I've been getting the feeling that anime is trying to portray student councils as a small group of decisionmakers very detached from the rest of the student body and who constantly create their own clique and meet in isolation to discuss the most random things. Could this actually be true about Japanese high schools in general? Is this a satirical work of writers who find no respect in their old schools' councils? Or are stories written this way just for the sake of comedy?

First off, the president is awesome.

Not because she's a sadist or anything.

And the treasurer is awesome too, because of her sheer size and ability to fly and kick people indirectly.

And there's the secretary who's like, not so straight.

I wonder if the student council here is appointed via beauty contest too...
