If I didn't know better, I think this guy was really in to it. Using 3D to render Haruhi and friends opening theme song to Motteke! Serafuku. Nice and professionally done, although there were some quirky areas and parts of it weren't animated properly, this is truly a video to be applauded.  
  
Don't get me wrong. I like the video but I don't like the guy. He made Mikuru look like Kyon's girlfriend -.-;
