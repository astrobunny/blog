And here I was thinking that Princess Lover was the best show this season. Little did I know we were in for some epic rock breaking and soul harvesting in Tokyo this season with Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 shaking up our 5.1 surround speakers. I don't know if there's any hype around this but it certainly isn't enough. I've got high expectations for this show.

Her mother too seems to be a very busy businesswoman. It seems like the kinds of stressful lifestyles undertaken by her parents have had an effect on her.

She writes in her blog "I've had enough. Everything is so troublesome. I wish everything and this world would just break.
