Sometimes you need to shoot  
for more bullets and for food  
I can't take things that suit my mood  
but anything I can take is good.  
  
People say the world is rough  
I think you need to be tough  
I need to scream "I've had enough"  
Even if it makes people laugh  
  
You need to be there to have a say  
Or you'll let people have their way  
Sometimes they call me tsundere  
But I just do things my own way  
  
Sometimes nice people come around  
And some people I need to pound  
Kicking asses to hear the sound  
Is a hobby of mine, and your the next round.
