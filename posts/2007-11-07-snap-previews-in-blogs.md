First, I'd like to start off with, this [danbooru-or-whatever-you-call-it](http://miezaru.donmai.us/post/show/138741/arisa-bannings-dieci-fate-testarossa-mahou-shoujo- "Have a good look") is pure win. The picture/popups cannot get any closer to the truth: You love Nanoha when she beats you up. This is also a perfect example of GOOD pop up info, which brings us to the next point: SNAP Previews.<!--more-->

Oh yes. Many people have intentionally put those SNAP Shots on their sites with the most sincere intention of annoying the jigoku out of people and make even their 8-core CPUs scream in pain.

Seriously, please **TAKE THOSE OFF YOUR BLOG** (Yes, I am talking about you DarkMirage) they are an enemy to humanity, a Tomogara Guze that squeezes the power of existence out of your blog, a pile of bovine manure, a picture that comes to life and tears your eyes out, a Nyoron fansub, the [WORST ANIME EVER](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpG1hWQwulA) and the reason your blog gets bashed [over](http://blog.mistakesofyouth.com/2007/11/03/mad/) and [over](http://www.riuva.com/?p=810) and [over](http://drmchsr0.wordpress.com/2007/10/22/dorama-srsly-you-jest/) and [over](http://drmchsr0.wordpress.com/2007/11/05/wildarmsheero-asks-for-it-again/) again; because people are psychologically disturbed by them.  
  
For those of you on wordpress.com, well, I don't blame you. They need the SNAP advertising to support themselves. And since that is for a good cause, I shall endure them and read your posts happily, knowing that you are standing on a platform supported by yourselves. However those who use it to further their own ends, you are no better than [s\*\*t](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/shit). Okay, fine I took that too far. But seriously, there are limits to how cluttered you can make your site. If you really don't understand, then [read this](http://www.great-web-design-tips.com/). I hope you see your reflection in the mirror.  
  
Anyway, happy blogging everyone and may you destroy your snapshots.
