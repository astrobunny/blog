If there's one thing I like about JC Staff, its the recent trend of them chibifying and comickizing the anime characters from anime that they animate that all started when they started their amazing Shakugan no Shana-tan series. I can't wait for them to do a chibified version of Nagi-tan and Hayate-tan as well. Yeah. This is just a moe/kawaii explosion post.
