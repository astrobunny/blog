Yes folks, I iz in AKL infiltratingz ur armegedonz. Armaggeddon Auckland was quite a bit bigger than [Armaggeddon Christchurch](http://www.astrobunny.net/2009/03/28/armaggeddon-expo-2009-christchurch/), but contrary to my expectations, apparent anime fandom is not directly proportional to the size of the event. Here's my scoop on this event that I was actually heavily anticipating.  
<!--more-->

With great power comes great responsibility and with great events comes great expectations. I think it goes without saying that the event has hit my expectations of the event actually being a pretty big event compared to Armageddon Christchurch. However, I have one expectation that the organizers probably have less control over.

That's right, kids. It's cosplay. And I have [high standards](http://www.astrobunny.net/2009/07/26/doujin-overload-2009/). Well, its probably better put this way: [Christchurch cosplayers are better](http://www.astrobunny.net/bloggallery/?album=1&gallery=1"). BUT. A round of applause for Akita Neru who was pretty damn obscure except to true vocaloid fans.

Your costume was even better than Len's. Well, if you would call uh... him Len.(They switched pants to play DDR too.) Len was pretty awesome at it though.  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0382-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0382.JPG)  
  
There was a Miku too! Her negi probably went past its expiration date though...

To Heart Lucky Star's cosplay is back too! Is this Kusakabe? Or Hiyori without glasses?  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Copy-of-DSC_0321-500x752.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Copy-of-DSC_0321.JPG)  
  
Captain Harlock was awesome too.   
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Copy-of-DSC_0386-500x752.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Copy-of-DSC_0386.JPG)  
  
There was also a non-loli Hanyuu desu.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Copy-of-DSC_0296-500x752.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Copy-of-DSC_0296.JPG)  
  
Shana is one of my favorite characters. I didn't recognize her until I took out my camera and actually looked at my photos. How dare they... never mind. Just a thought, is Suou from Tamaki?  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Copy-of-DSC_0301-500x752.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Copy-of-DSC_0301.JPG)  
  
Delicious Meido is awesome. Zettais are awesome. Ribbons on stockings are awesome. Full marks.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Copy-of-DSC_0363-500x752.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Copy-of-DSC_0363.JPG)  
  
OMG. Seifer. Where's Rinoa and Squall?  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0076-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0076.JPG)  
  
Alright enough about cosplayers because there really isn't anything to talk about. The event was held on the ASB Showgrounds, which was a really big convention center. I'm not sure how to describe its bigness. Let's just say its 6 basketball courts.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0126-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0126.JPG)  
  
Here's the back of the building which had the better banner.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0434-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0434.JPG)  
  
And this was the line in front.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_04351-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_04351.JPG)  
  
It's nowhere near the Comiket's line though.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_01401-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_01401.JPG)  
  
Tragic's booth is back with lots of B Love.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0146-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0146.JPG)  
  
There was a big telescope but the eyepiece was blocked...  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0248-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0248.JPG)  
  
EA games had a band too. Not sure what the beatles thing was all about though.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0257-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0257.JPG)  
  
The Xbox stage was pretty big too. Though they were just showcases of games that were already done to death on youtube.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0185-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0185.JPG)  
  
There was even an R18 section that was guarded by men in orange from south africa.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0189-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0189.JPG)  
  
I was expecting to see something a little more than something 12 year olds already play and know about.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0187-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0187.JPG)  
  
Y...y...you know ,just so you know I wasn't expecting hentai or anything like that \>.\>  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0196-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0196.JPG)  
  
There were lots of Made in China goods too.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0200-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0200.JPG)  
  
One store of note is a hobby shop that was taken care of by people who uttered Japanese like they spoke it daily. Of course, they had some pretty nice stuff there.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0205-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0205.JPG)  
  
The Evangelion craze lives.

They even have little puchis for sale.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0212-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0212.JPG)  
  
They even had all these awesome Gundams  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0214-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0214.JPG)

These little badges that lit up were really cool too. They like blinked and stuff.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0254-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0254.JPG)  
  
There was the goth loli store too. Amu would like some of the dresses here.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0267-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0267.JPG)  
  
In the second hall it was pretty quiet, and there was this funny booth selling inflatables. They even had a decorated car, but they put it somewhere no one to see them.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0269-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0269.JPG)  
  
Its a nice car right? I don't know why they put it in the corner.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0271-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0271.JPG)  
  
The Wii area. Wii would like to play.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0276-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0276.JPG)  
  
There was also this cool yellow tub with plastic balls...  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0277-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0277.JPG)  
  
That you roll around inside of.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0283-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0283.JPG)  
  
There was also this wrestling ring where you don this magnormous suit  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0289-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0289.JPG)  
  
And bounce around trying to err... bounce your opponent. This should be turned into an olympic sport.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_01591-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_01591.JPG)  
  
The playstation castle is also filled with win.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0160-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0160.JPG)  
  
Because games are only fun when you have friends around.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0243-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0243.JPG)  
  
There were also some awesome independant artists. A shout out to the NinjaCats. Get their manga and show them their support! His drawings, despite being simple are pretty inspired. Most of us know that manga takes a lot of effort to draw, but result is really what matters, and the cats were freakin hilarious.

I love it when people bring the Internets to real\_life.exe  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0402-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0402.JPG)  
  
And finally, this wouldnt be a post by Astrobunny if I didnt talk about how Kagami and Tsukasa dressed up specially for the event.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0330-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0330.JPG)  
  
They are awesome aren't they.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0344-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0344.JPG)  
  
And now for some fanservice.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_03491-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_03491.JPG)  
  
For some reason I feel nervous when Tsukasa holds guns up and stuff.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0351-500x332.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-DSC_0351.JPG)  
  
But that was the least of my worries because a yan Rena found me.
