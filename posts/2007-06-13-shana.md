It's been a while since I wrote about an anime character, so I decided to write about one that I am currently watching about. Yes. Its Shana. As in Enpatsu Shakugan no Shana. Actually, this description is misleading as she is only known as the girl with burning hair and eyes when she activates her powers. Her hair is originally black and her eyes a very dark dull green. She is the main character in the anime Shakugan no Shana. The name Shana is given to her by Sakai Yuji, the male lead of the series after her sword, Nietono no Shana.<!--more-->  
  
 ![](wp-images/old/albums/random/shakugan.jpg)Shana is a well-educated and highly combat trained girl. Orphaned at a very young age, she is taken up and looked after by a Guze King known as Alastor and Wilhelmia, a Flame Haze. In the world of Shakugan no Shana, Flame Hazes keep the world's order by suppressing the actions of the Guze Tomogaras, while carrying the essence of a Guze King, who provides the powers to do their job. Shana was trained with the intentions of creating a Flame Haze in mind by Shiro, Alastor and Wilhelmia, all who have very specific reasons, including a promise to the previous Enpatsu Shakugan Hunter to train a new girl to take her place.  
  
 ![](wp-images/old/albums/random/sakai.jpg)Shana met Sakai Yuji during another round of stopping Rinnes, monsters working for Guze Tomogaras to collect powers of existence. Sakai Yuji at that time, had already been eaten, and was left as a Mistes carrying a relic called the Reiji Maigo, which prevents him from disappearing. Knowing that Sakai carries a treasure very much sought after by the Guze Tomogaras, she decides to use him as bait to lure the Tomogaras instead. In order to do so, she replaces a torch known as Hirai as Sakai's classmate, which was initially met with opposition from Sakai.  
  
Without a place to stay, Shana constantly hung out with Sakai and spent nights at his house. Eventually, she started to become closer to Sakai, causing her to become frustrated with the feelings and causing her to hesitate in her work. this gradually became an asset during her battles as her encouragement grows with his presence. However, she is also involved with a jealousy fight in Sakai's school with another girl.  
  
 ![](wp-images/old/albums/melonpan.jpg)Shana enjoys Melon Bread, and constantly buys it for her lunches. Her love for Melon Bread can be traced back to the days of her training when she was always given Melon Bread to eat after her practice fights with a skeleton named Shiro. She is unable to cook - a skill deemed unnecessary for her profession as a Flame Haze. However, she stubbornly tries to learn it, after her infatuation with Sakai.  
  
 ![](wp-images/old/albums/random/nietono.jpg)Shana's main weapon is a sword known as Nietono no Shana, which she gained from a Mistes during her inauguration as a Flame Haze in the Palace of the Road to Heaven. Thanks to her work, the Nietono no Shana eventually became known as a flaming sword, causing several Tomogaras to seek it hoping to gain its flames. However, Shana uses the weapon only as a tool to channel the flames she possesses from Alastor. The flames she possesses also give her the ability to fly freely by means of immaterial fire wings. The Nietono no Shana is carried in her magical cloak that she carries around with her. It is capable of storing everything she needs.  
  
 ![](wp-images/old/albums/random/young.jpg)A mystery still surrounds the reason Shana did not have a name to begin with, before becoming a Flame Haze. Most of the characters only refer to her in pronouns. Most probably because she was only in a place with few people, names were not required to hail. After her becoming a Flame Haze, she was referred to as the Enpatsu Shakugan Hunter (The Hunter with the burning hair and flaming eyes).
