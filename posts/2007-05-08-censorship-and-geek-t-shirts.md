Its been almost a month since the HD DVD key release and all the hype caused by it is still going strong. I see numerous T-shirts all over the place with the entire set of hexadecimal numbers slapped on to them in a hundred different ways. Its almost as if Christ just came for the second time and everyone is welcoming Him with open arms and slapped an image of Him on to his shirts. Of course, the key release does mean that all the encryption on the media on HD DVDs released so far is now deemed useless, since every Tom, Dick and Harry can start watching those shows without having to get a proper decoder that pays Toshiba and NEC millions to produces players that can read HD DVD movies.<!--more-->

Not that its a bad thing, but don't you feel sad for all the developers who spent millions and billions of dollars finding the perfect way to store the highest number of bits possible on such a small disc but ended up getting ripped of their long-awaited income when a group of hackers blew the encryption cover? Oh well... I guess that's what makes the world go round.  
  
Speaking of T-shirts, we were just looking into some more cool ones out there that apparently have struck a geek chord with us. Here are some of the better ones out there. I really like the missing image one XD
