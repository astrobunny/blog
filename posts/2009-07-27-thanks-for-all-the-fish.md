I didn't expect my last blog post to be embraced with such a warm response, and I would like to thank Tadano Suki, Nakano Azusa, Katherine Williams, Tuna, Kimura Reiko, Tiara, Suna, Sylvia, Kate, Rita and Sancta for posting all those constructive comments from the same IP address.  
  
I'd like to say that I really enjoyed the event, and the cosplayers were a lot of fun too. I'm not sure why the spammer got so hot and bothered about what I said about the cosplayers because its true, but I'll let it say what it must to get over it. For those of you who were awesome, kudos. To those of you who failed, just try harder and earn a place of praise in my future posts.  
  
And to the one I bought posters from, you're awesome ;). See you at Armaggeddon.
