Tsundere x Awesome = Win Win Win. The Epitome of Beauty and Harmony of the Universe has finally come upon us! Tsundere princess Kagami has finally appeared in our physical world mixed in with the internet idol Hatsune Miku, the current Goddess of Sound! Finally tangible, we must all praise Good Smile Company highly for creating such an awesome figma. Let us not forget Kyoto Animation too, which pulled off one of the most amazing cosplay mixups in anime history! Kagami and Miku is a harmonization akin to the combined singing of the Muses. More pics after the jump.

Kagami, although seen as feeling awkward while cosplaying Miku, is actually secretly hoping Konata looks at her more. You can see how she so easily calms down even when Konata tells her she will only turn back after midnight.

Just look at her. She always does this when no one she knows is looking at her and feeling slightly happy that Konata thinks she looks cute.

Of course, since the faces are the same scale as the Summer Uniform version of Kagami, we can attach her face to the Summer Uniform figma.
