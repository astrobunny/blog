And so I've completed my Kyonko figma. It actually came as a surprise to me that although there were lots of figma mods out there, few mods were actually Kyonko mods. Its surprising because it's so easy to do. I've also realized that becoming a figma modder isn't anything special, but rather the next step after being a figma collecter. It makes sense, since the whole point I became a figma collector was because I loved this stuff. Anyway, it turns out the brown paint for the hair wasn't as dry as I thought it was, and I should've let it cure a bit longer. Perhaps after this I'll repaint the hair to get a more lasting finish.
