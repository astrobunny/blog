After a long one and a half months of struggling with university work, I finally have my real life back. Not the imaginary one. The real one. I find myself sitting at home thinking about what I'm supposed to do, which hasn't happened for a very very very long time. I thought to myself, wow... one and a half months really flew by quickly, now I'm left in a pool of anime to watch, and some, if not most of which are going to end pretty soon. Seems like only yesterday when everyone was so excited about the release of the new ones. Time flies indeed. Anyway, with the extra free time, looks like more manga is in order. Thanks everyone for coming to my site while I was away! Those who have faith will be duly rewarded.  
  
Look forward to updates again!
