I was in the cathedral square last night along with a crowd of people watching Black Velvet's New Year Concert and the countdown to this year. Of course, Kagami the stowaway followed me.

All the roads around and leading to the cathedral square were closed for the event. Which meant I had to look for other places to park at. I got lucky and got a spot just outside an Irish bar.

There was a liquor ban in effect at the area. It just meant you can't carry anything containing alcohol into the square.

Nice christmas tree in the square.

Kagami likes the christmas tree and its constantly changing lights.

There was even a bunch of public toilets ready for those who ate the wrong thing before the event.

There was lots of Indian food too. Was full at the time so I didn't even consider grabbing a bite.

The conspicuous police presence made us all feel so much safer.

The cathedral at night.

Everyone was just sitting around to enjoy the atmosphere.

There was even a big projection screen showing the camviews of the concert.

Tech teams and DJs doing their stuff.

There were even people who brought their own pro filming equipment to film the event. I was merely armed with my D90.

The concert proper was in the distance. It was time to start squeezing my way into the area.

And I somehow got into the front by getting pushed and shoved.  
  
Here's a little video of the last few minutes of 2009 at the square:

Finally it was 1st January 2010. Happy New Year everyone.
