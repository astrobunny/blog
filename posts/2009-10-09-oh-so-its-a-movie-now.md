It turns out Kadokawa decided to finish off the anticipation with an awesome feature length movie of Tanigawa's masterpiece in the Suzumiya Haruhi line of novels. Although they did hint it to be after Sighs, I didn't think it wouldn't be part of the TV series. Oh well, looks like another cockblocker for us gaikokujin. As if the endless eight was not enough...
