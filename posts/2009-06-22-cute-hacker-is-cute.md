Today I want to talk about how much I admire Karin. I have always wanted a big round table that would surround me with displays and that I can do all my work on. Also, those hairclips are the awesomest things in the world. Ahh... some people can be so lucky.

Although I don't say it often, I always wonder what kind of person I would grow up to be had I been blessed with the machines this girl has at an age similar to hers. I wonder if I would be any different from now. Perhaps I would've made a more competent hacker? Or perhaps I would completely lack social skills?

I used to hug a teddy bear when I was little, but I don't remember when I stopped. I wonder if I grew up with computers all around me, and at that age writing programs to manipulate the stock market, I wonder how I would live when I grow up?

My thoughts are that familiarity breeds contempt, and I'd probably end up someone who doesn't use a computer much anymore and instead become one who does a lot more outside work such as gardening and sports than spend all my time in the world in front of an OLED display.

Though, I might just as easily miss all my days in front of the computer, and eventually return to hacking, only to discover the leaps and bounds in technological advancements made after I swore off computers for a while, have left me with a less than steady grasp on the operation of more modern machines.

Or perhaps I could find out by providing one of my children someday with an education, exposure and equipment unlike any normal child has seen before, and have them grasp advanced technical concepts at an early age, and train them in the ways of scientific rigor and mathematical formalism, giving them an undisputable edge over their peers in the application of technology.

From that, a more fundamental question of ethics emerges: Should I?
