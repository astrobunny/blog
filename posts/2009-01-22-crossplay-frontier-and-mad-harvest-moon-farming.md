I can see why now parents are reluctant to buy DS'es for kids. They are so friggin addictive. I spent like, 3 pure days just playing Harvest Moon DS from day to night, and I learned the economics of scale and human resources. You can't do everything yourself, but if you're making enough, you can pay people to make your money for you.

Mad industrial farming for the win.

I actually bagged about 100k every season from this, plus wages for the harvest sprites. Very promising farmland. Maybe I should start a farming company.
