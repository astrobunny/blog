"Seriously. I have no idea why Kuroko always gets me into trouble. Now I have to clean the halls with her AGAIN because of all that noise she made. I KNOW her breast sizes are like proportionally large compared to mine but I don't see why she has to keep flashing me like that. It's just so awkward"

"Speaking of which, I think Judgement's people have too much confidence in the Judgement databases. I mean, come on. The information in the database can only be as good as the people who enter it in. If someone makes a mistake, there WILL be a mistake. If someone wasn't registered, it doesn't mean he or she didn't exist. It only means database just doesnt have the record!"

"Come to think of it, Uiharu loves to put all these flowers on her head. I wonder why anyway? She's quite the cutesy, which I find kinda nice. Ah I wish I had a sister like her, so I can tease her like this: 'I wonder why I don't grow flowers on my head but you do? Do you come from the same parents?' Just kidding :P "

"Oh, she even left her armband, and would you believe it, someone actually thought I was in Judgement just because I had the armband, and she even thought I was her assistant! Talk about disorganizedness. You'd think such an important organization would at least BRIEF the people on who they are partnering. Anyway, the maps of the city suck. I live here and I can't even recognize the road layout on the maps. How in the world do they make these maps anyway? Why don't they just take photographs from the sky and then draw lines on it?"

"This Judgement girl then got this little mission to find a bag. I was like oh no! Kuroko said something about a criminal that makes aluminium explode and how children's bags have aluminium with them now! I thought they wanted us to find a bomb! But I think that she's a little pompous. When I was squeezing through an alley, she said she couldn't fit in there. I got a little angry for a while. Well, its like saying 'my breasts are bigger than yours! Sorry!' Well, sorry I'm flat enough to walk through nooks and crannies."

"She was looking for the bag in all the wrong places. I mean, the field? That bug infested field? How would any child's bag roll into it? I mean, why would a child even BE here? It's full of these weird bugs that so creep me out."

"And children nowadays are so weird. Why do they flip a girl's skirt as if it was a leaf on the floor?! Don't parents teach manners anymore nowadays?! The government seriously needs to revise its anti-spanking laws."

"Phew. So much happened today. I think I'm going to catch a cold after being completely drenched by the water today when I was attempting to save the bag that I thought was a bomb. Who would've known to look in a playground for a bag? I mean, why would girls even come here when there are so many skirt flipping brats all around? And Kuroko isn't helping either. I really hope I'll get enough sleep tonight or this running nose is going to become a sneeze and sore throat. Please God, let Kuroko NOT wake up in the middle of the night and jump on me... Please please please..."

"P.S. There was one cool thing about today though. I met the owner of the bag, which was SUCH A CUTE LITTLE GIRL! AAAH I WANT HER TO BE MY SISTER TOO. Oh I hope I have a dream where me, Uiharu and the little girl go to the beach with our parents! That would be so much fun!"  
  
"Though that would probably be unlikely" \*gazes at a dazed Kuroko\*
