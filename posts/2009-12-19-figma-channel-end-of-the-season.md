Tsukasa: Hey did you notice that the shows lately were pretty short?  
Kagami: What do you mean?

Tsukasa: Well Bakemonogatari ended in like 13, well Konata says its probably going to go a little longer, and Seitokai is already going to finish next week, and so is Kampfer.

Kagami: Yeah. Maybe the studios decided that they'd make a short sweet series with lots of compelling characters and then live off the merchandise after that. Then the animation would cost so much less and they won't lose as much to downloads.

Kagami: Which reminds me of this crazy show called Kampfer was it? Konata's always coming to tell me how she's like lesbian for Natsuru and stuff and says its okay because she really is actually a boy and stuff...

Kagami: It makes me wonder how you can obsess over a character to that point. I mean, its 2D and stuff, so it doesn't really exist, and the part about the boy transforming into a girl in seconds when a kampfer nearby is just nuts. How can anyone even watch that stuff?

Kagami: I wonder what would happen if she woke up one day and found out that she was a guy? That would be so freakin awesome then. HAHAHAHA

Konata: Hmmm. I should skip school today...
