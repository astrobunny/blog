Alright! Time for another update. Today, I've wasted more time playing games! XD It's fun tho. Though it took us a whole day to play only 2 games of Gem Tower Defense on Warcraft III. Oh my. Another day wasted on gaming. When will this insanity end? Though, that wasn't the fun part. The fun part was having n00bicity actually play Hungry Hungry Felhounds and Sliding Bunnies. All of which you can find on epicwar.com or google, if you just search for them. I might put the links up if anyone is interested? Sliding bunnies is about bunnies trying to get out of somewhere full of ice. But they can't walk on the ice, so all they can do is slide on the ice and steer, through wolves and other evil obstacles of course. Hungry Hungry Felhounds is a game like tag. A felhound will eat the person who is "tagged" if he gets close enough to eat him. So the person who's "it" must tag another person, which isn't as easy as it sounds... but that's where the fun is XD. Anyway, while I go wash my dishes, here are some cute screenies from Sliding bunnies.
