A murder mystery game made by the same people that brought us Higurashi no Naku Koro ni has now been made into an anime as well. And I must that I was never so surprised when I started watching this one. Umineko no Naku Koro ni has got this awesome OP that so gets me into the mood for a murder mystery. Three episodes have passed so far, and I wonder whose alibi isn't sound...

One of my favorite things about this show is the big nice sinister smiles of Ushiromiya Maria. Oh yes. Look at the way she smiles. I would love to have a cute little sister like this too to watch for witches for me. I mean, I wouldnt complain or anything.

And the other awesome thing about this show is Beatrice. Yes. The perpetrator of all that is so wrong yet so right on this twisted family. I don't usually get turned on so much by blondes, but this one TURNS ME ON. She does all sorts of things my principles don't agree with, yet I get the feeling that I will follow upon her beckoning. I can tell now why Kinzo is so eager to see her smile again. I am too. I need to get Kinzo to drop me a line when this witch comes to visit.

Oh cute Maria before she reads out the obituary of some people tonight. Lovable Maria goes Oyashiro-samaBeatrice-sama when she starts reading the letter that tells everyone that they are in line to be one of the thirteen people to die on the night of the termination of Kinzo's contract.

Of course, the pretty girls of the Ushiromiya Family look on in horror. How good their faces look when faced with certain death.

Desperate eldest son is desperate.

I wonder if we're going to see any more of this gold during the series. Well, I think we will, since human beings always work very well under pressure that they don't like. I wonder if there's a place where I can sell my soul too for 20 billion yen. I mean, its just the soul right? How bad could it be?

As a bonus you get all these awesome looking grand-daughters. I saved this best scene for last because since Beatrice knew Kinzo since such a long time ago, she must be way too experienced for me. Shannon's taken already, but I'll post about her later anyway. The other Ushiromiya girls are either too young or already completely worn used goods. That leaves Jessica, another awesome blonde that's nice and ripe. She seems to look nothing like her parents (I wonder where she came from anyway) however, that's not going to stop me from hoping that from here onwards our resident tsundere is going to catch the witch and have a nice catfight with her.
