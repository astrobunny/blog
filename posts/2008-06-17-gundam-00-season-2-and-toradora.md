If you can read Japanese, it seems the second season of Gundam 00 is coming out this October, which isn't very far away at all. They say that the second half of the story will be played out starting from October as Season 2 of Gundam 00  
  
Looks like there is some good stuff in the line-up this year. Although KyoAni has been rather quiet about it, word has leaked out that Haruhi Season 2 will be coming out this Autumn, and CLANNAD 2 doesn't seem too far away either, but there seems to be some news that has caught my eye on dengeki called Toradora. It is a high school love comedy about some ordinary guy and the top-ranking Tiger of the school, Aisaka Taiga. That looks like something that could be pretty fun to watch. \*Jumps in anticipation. Meanwhile, look out for Toki's project on Zero no Tsukaima 3 that's gonna start this July 7th!
