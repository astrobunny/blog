To all of you who are regular readers of Ars Technica and SlashDot and random posts from Digg and del.icio.us, here's an alternative read to satisfy those brain cells of yours craving new content. Marvin is a friend of mine who loves to talk about technology. Well, after much deliberation he decided to spread his rants for the whole world to see. Thus, 50volts.com was born. Now you can enjoy one more blog filled with the latest praises to apple, google features and lots more original content. Yes and I do mean original content. He writes the blog himself, and doesn't copy and paste like most @@#%@sites do. Don't take my word for it, hop on over now to [50volts.com](http://50volts.com/ "50Volts.com blog")
