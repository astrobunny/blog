You gotta admit, Kuroko's got style, but her taste is somewhat misaligned with her looks. Though, there are greater forces at play here. The anime industry is not only encouraging boys to be gay, its ENCOURANGING GIRLS TO BE LESBIAN, as we have seen with Kampfer and a few other shows.

Her jump is awesome. I have yet to see a dormitory room with such a high roof.

Her imagination is awesome too. She must be one of those John Hancock movie fans.

And her bold wardrobe leaves little to the imagination.

Similar to what Saten is wondering, I also wonder what she uses all these suits for.

Though I can see where she's coming from with this one...  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Ayako-A-Certain-Scientific-Railgun-02-HQH2646A47877A_11-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Ayako-A-Certain-Scientific-Railgun-02-HQH2646A47877A_11.jpg)  
  
... get it? coming from? =D ... okay that was a little lame...  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Ayako-A-Certain-Scientific-Railgun-02-HQH2646A47877A_15-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Ayako-A-Certain-Scientific-Railgun-02-HQH2646A47877A_15.jpg)  
  
This isn't hers by the way. Wait... doesn't she have any normal pantsu? Oh... I guess it depends on how you define normal ...

Also, this must be the best lingerie advertisement ever created. If a brand was tied to this, I would be able to imagine the legions of otaku marching towards the womens' section of the departmental store with the mission of enriching a certain company which sells the certain brand.

Who wouldv'e thought of glow-in-the-dark lingerie. This is so getting patented.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Ayako-A-Certain-Scientific-Railgun-02-HQH2646A47877A_16-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Ayako-A-Certain-Scientific-Railgun-02-HQH2646A47877A_16.jpg)  
  
Her obsession with Misaka is nothing short of amazing. If we were to assume the entire album was filled with photos like these, I think such a collection will rake in roulette money on Amazon. No points for guessing where the money's going to come from.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Ayako-A-Certain-Scientific-Railgun-02-HQH2646A47877A_23-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Ayako-A-Certain-Scientific-Railgun-02-HQH2646A47877A_23.jpg)  
  
Even the mere sight of Misaka's sweat drenched shirt puts her face into blush mode. This girl has some serious issues.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Ayako-A-Certain-Scientific-Railgun-02-HQH2646A47877A_24-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Ayako-A-Certain-Scientific-Railgun-02-HQH2646A47877A_24.jpg)  
  
She got a present from Misaka.  
  
/me cracks knuckles

About the only thing preventing me from hitting her dead is the fact that she is so cute... and that my screen costed me $700.

I wonder where people get the courage to do things like these. Though I guess there are very honest people around who announce their feelings for another on a PA speaker.

Though we also see here that Kuroko is a bit of a masochist.  
  
 [![](wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Ayako-A-Certain-Scientific-Railgun-02-HQH2646A47877A_32-500x281.jpg "Picture")](/images/wp-uploads/2009/10/wpid-Ayako-A-Certain-Scientific-Railgun-02-HQH2646A47877A_32.jpg)  
  
Yep. She definitely seems to be enjoying it.
