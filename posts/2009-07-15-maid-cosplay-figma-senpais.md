My recent infatuation with Yuu has prompted me to open one of those figma boxes I hadn't bothered to open until now. Strangely I wonder where all the excitement of opening these boxes went. I guess its just a transient thing.

Okay so besides Tsuruya and yet another face, we see a blob of orange hair on the side. Looks like Max Factory really is trying to push people to buy 2 boxes of this, so they can grab their own Mikuru figma and dress her up as a maid too. Well that's not a bad business strategy. After all, otaku are not known for their thriftiness.

Here's Tsuruya! Max Factory has not slacked yet, and we get a similar level of goodness in the figma when compared to the 1/8 scale statue. I just love how photogenic the folds on the dress are. And that forehead. That magnormous forehead... Someone needs to go up there and draw something on it. \*restrains self\*

Similar to the school uniform Tsuruya-san, the figma's hair's weight forces one to push the legs as far back as possible to maintain a good center of gravity for balancing. Once you do this several times you start to get the hang of it and know how much to push the legs back to balance the figma.

"Ehhh... Tsuruya-san... why are you staring at me like that..."

"Stop crying and let me tie this ribbon."

"There we go. I hereby crown you MEIDO PRIME"  
"Ehhh Tsuruya-san... I can do this by myself... It's embarrassing... people are watching..."
