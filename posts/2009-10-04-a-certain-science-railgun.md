Despite this being just a spinoff of Toaru Majutsu no Index, I'm so looking forward to this because it emphasizes MISAKA. That's right. There's something about electricity that makes me all warm and fuzzy inside. That's probably why I'm an electrical engineer.

One of the nice things about this anime is it focuses squarely on a different clique of friends in the Academy City, and the strangely moe and twintailed lesbian Judgement member.

Not only is she moe in a twintailed way, she's also a teleporter, which makes for some very very nice fighting scenes when she's fired up.

And she's very close to some of her friends no doubt. The ecchi thrown in always appeals to me.

Another awesome point about this anime is the level 1 Judgement girl with flowers on her head. Despite being a Level 1, she's got a lot less confidence in herself than her Mio-lookalike friend,

At least she isn't as generic as Mio, but the side tails falling to the front of the shoulders seems to be growing on me. I blame Mio for that. She's a Level 0, but she's earned my respect this episode by being the heroine rescuing the shota in distress.

But just the characters don't make a good story, and I don't care if the story is good or bad as long as its a good watch, and Index was and this looks like its set to follow in the footsteps of Index, by putting in some ridiculous humour that doesn't really make me laugh and have some nice slice of life scenes going on that make me "aww".

Most people find what I'm trying to say weird because I watch anime to relax, and not to analyse it to bits like a food critic. what took me was also the Mio-lookalike's preconceptions about Misaka's Level 5-ness and how she would be all cocky like the rest of the high levellers in town.

Contrary to that, she is as much a girl as anyone else, even having little petty desires all of us exhibit once in a while. This was actually what I looked like when I discovered that Kagamin was sold out a few months back when I started my figma collection. I can relate to this, so I like it.

And last of all, this show has got lots of action from anime mass-producers JC Staff. This stuff always fires me up no matter how ridiculous it is. So if you ask me to rate this show, I'll give you a short "MUST WATCH".
