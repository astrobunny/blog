You're a girl too! You know that right?! What are you getting so flustered about with Saki going "Let's go to the finals!". And why are you licking your little finger after you remembered the finger crossing with Saki?! What are you doing!?

I mean, I SAW you! You were like "OMFG I'm touching Saki!" or something to that effect when Saki was finally burning up with passion for mahjong. NODOKA YOUR LIFE IS IN MAHJONG, NOT IN BEING LESBIAN! There! I said it! Stop getting flustered when you're with Saki!

I mean, yeah, Saki's cute and all and that little body is so huggable and that smile would make me forget all of my anxieties and anger, and all I probably need is her... BUT NODOKA YOU'RE A GIRL! GET THAT RIGHT AND STAY AWAY FROM SAKI.

I mean, I don't mind you being someone's wife, and cooking dinner for your husband after he's had a tiring day's work, and coming home to a great wife and, you could also be my wife if you wanted too... N-n-n-not that I'm implying anything or stuff but...

BUT SERIOUSLY NODOKA! YOU ARE A GIRL, JUST LIKE SAKI, NORTH POLE AND NORTH POLE, THE TWO OF YOU DON'T FIT TOGETHER, NEITHER DO YOU CONNECT, well, in a physical way anyway, BUT MY POINT IS LIKE CHARGES REPEL! STOP... GETTING ALL DERE AROUND SAKI!  
  
Though... on second thought, I'm all for 2Girls1MahjongTile
