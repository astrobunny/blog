Preorders just started on a Mariya figure made by Orchard Seed. I must say that it is another one of the very few figures that have tickled my taste buds. Somehow my mind and heart are split into two parts now. One tells me that "I should not be gay", another part of me tells me that "a boy is fine too"

Curse the evil figure making company for creating the forbidden fruit for Adam to eat. Even I, pristine as I may be, cannot help but watch my principles fall into the depths of carnal desires. The temptation may be too great for me to withstand. Only time will tell if I will end up buying this figure and using it for health purposes.

Or it may just be a normal bodily urge of a healthy boy.

In any case, if I was a pressure cooker, my lid is already stuck in the ceiling. It MIGHT just be a matter of time before she joins in my small team of statues in Mai Room HQ. Below is a very coveted image that may influence many peoples' decision between "buy" and "don't buy" I am still cut in half however.
