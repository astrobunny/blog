Do you see any resemblance? Maybe Youhei was an adopted child?  
  
CLANNAD is finally getting a move on with the Nagisa x Tomoya action. Oh man, how long do I have to withstand this torture!? When will Okazaki stop being gay and look at Nagisa! UGH.

Meanwhile, to keep myself entertained, <!--more-->I'd much rather the story go fast or go like this:

"Go to hell, Okazaki~"  
  
And then Nagisa transforms into a pile of junk and runs off to become the soulmate of a mysterious girl trapped in the end of the world.
