I just read [Kenny Sia](http://kennysia.com)'s blog on his invitation and attending some big huge grand integrated resort owned by some Las Vegas company owned by the 3rd richest man in the world in Macau, and I thought... "wow, so you can eat gold". But I think that all that metal and stone in the big huge grand integrated resort owned by some Las Vegas company owned by the 3rd richest man in the world in Macau is nothing compared to the massive wonders of the cherry blossoms now in full bloom in [where I live](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&client=opera&rls=en&hs=xFM&q=new+zealand&btnG=Search)!

YES!! Its sakura!!!　桜の花！The national flower of Japan! We all know why the Japanese made it their national flower. Its because there aren't enough cute girls there to pair up with the hikikomori population there that they needed something pretty to replace their cultural image. XD I'm just kidding. (なんちゃって。。。）

The flowers are super awesome. Since they are in full bloom they are like spreading their petals as if new trees would grow out of them, and everytime the wind blows, we get to see a massive spray of pink and and awesome effect most people only see in movies. And YES the petals do fall on your hair, get stuck and follow you home. It happened to me.

I'm sure Kenny Sia sitting in his hotel marvelling at the artificial halls of silver and yellow has so missed out on the awesome pink cloud of natural beauty that took millions of years to develop to satisfy our optical nerves. So, for those of you who don't have the chance to go to Macau's big huge grand integrated resort owned by some Las Vegas company owned by the 3rd richest man in the world, don't fret. for your rewards are great under the Sakura Tree.
